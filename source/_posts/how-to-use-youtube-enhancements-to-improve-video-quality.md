## How to Use YouTube Enhancements

 First of all, you need to locate YouTube Enhancements. As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.

![Locate enhancements features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg )

 Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.

![Qucik Fix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg )

 Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.

![YouTube Filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg )

 Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.

![YouTube Costum Blurring](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg )

 Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.

## How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos

![Adjust Contrast Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg )

 If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:

Then you can click on the Create button and save the video where you want, in the format of your choosing.

Have you seen everything on Netflix? Does nothing pique your interest in Hulu or Amazon Prime Video? Can I entice you with a free YouTube movie?

To watch full-length movies for free, you don't need to rent a movie or sign up for a YouTube Premium subscription. Hundreds of movies are accessible for free on YouTube if you don't mind having your movie-watching pleasure interrupted by the occasional ad.

If you're willing to pay to stream, YouTube boasts as large a collection of new movies as anyone. However, the video streaming site features a large, though difficult-to-find, a library of legal free movies. Not talking about strangely uploaded, blurry, shaky movies. Along with viral stars and adorable animal montages, genuine, 100 percent free (and good) movies are available.

## 1\. SUNRISE

#### The plot of the movie

A farmer (George O'Brien) is bored with his wife (Janet Gaynor), their baby, and the monotony of farm life when he falls under the spell of a flirty city lady (Margaret Livingston), who persuades him to drown his wife so they can flee together. When his wife suspects his plot and flees to the city, the farmer pursues her, gradually recovering her trust as the two rediscover their love for each other in this award-winning silent classic.
