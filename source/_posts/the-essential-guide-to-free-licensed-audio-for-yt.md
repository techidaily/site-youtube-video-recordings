Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.

## Part 1: What Does 'Royalty Free' Mean?

'Royalty free' does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a 'music by' note in your video's description.

Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube's flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.

Are you an online video creator searching for royalty free music for videos? It is evident that a video must have a perfect soundtrack for video masterpieces, but ensuring it is copyright free music is a must.

It is because you would never want YouTube to remove your video due to copyright violation after working so hard on it. Fortunately, there are a few trusted resources that offer perfect royalty free music for youtube videos.

Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.

## Part 1: What Does 'Royalty Free' Mean?

'Royalty free' does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a 'music by' note in your video's description.

Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube's flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.
