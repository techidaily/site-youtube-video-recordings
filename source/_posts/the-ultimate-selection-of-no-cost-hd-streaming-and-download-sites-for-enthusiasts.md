![Top 1 video download site](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/video-download-sites-1.jpg)

**Top 1: savefrom.net**

Savefrom.net is a very straightforward video download site, and the most convenient way to download videos with this site tool is just simply add "ss" in front of "youtube.com" in the video url. i.e. change www.youtube.com/xxx to www.ssyoutube.com/xxx and then hit Enter, you will come to the download page. And it is probably the most popular way or the easiest way to download a video, but the shortcoming of this video download site is that it doesn't support download full HD video and it is not always working. 

![Top 2 video download site](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/video-download-sites-2.jpg) 

 **Top 2 savemedia.com**

Seems like savemedia.com has already merged with keep-tube. You don't need to copy and paste URL to download videos with this video download sites either, simply replace the url youtube.com/xxx with savemedia.com/xxx and you will be redirected to the video download page of savemedia.com. It also has the desktop downloader called Vdownloader. Sometimes when the site tool doesn't work, you can try Vdownloader to download videos.

**Top 3 savevideo.me** 

It does't say on this video download site that it supports to download videos, and if you try to copy and paste the url of a video on this site, it is also unable to analyze the URL. However, there is a simple workaround way, if you add the word "magic" between "you" and "tube" like www.youmagictube.com/xxx, you will be able to jump to the downloading page! Strange isn't it. And this video download site also support to download MP3 audio directly and supports other video sites such as Dailymotion, Vine, etc. But be aware of the ads in case you accidently click it.

**Top 4 Deturl**

This video download site is a bit different from others, it adapt the way of recording video and audio to download MP4 and MP3\. If you want to use this site to download online videos, please be patient, because there is a "endless" redirect, and finally you will be able to download the MP4 or MP3 file only. There is also a simple way which is add "pwn" in front of the video URL, i.e. www.pwnyoutube.com/xxx, and then you will go to the download page directly. 

As a matter of fact, relying on a website to download online videos is not a long plan. Despite the ads or virus the sites may contain, lesson has been told that online video download sites are not stable, today it may be available like clipconverter.cc, and tomorrow it may be sued like YouTube-mp3.org, or it just occasionally not working like Keepvid.com. The best way to avoid someday you will try to find another alternative site to download online videos, you can just stick to [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) â€“ your default online video downloader software.
