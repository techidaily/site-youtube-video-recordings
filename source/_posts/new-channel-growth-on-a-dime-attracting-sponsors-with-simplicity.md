### 2\. Reach Out Directly

Reaching out to the people directly is one of the tried and tested ways to acquire YouTube sponsorship for small channels. Research and try to find 50 to 100 companies that would be interested in your channel.

It will not be much difficult to search for that one person within this list whom you can connect with directly. Once you have the company’s list and detailed contact information of those companies, send a mail inviting them to check your channel and show your interest to partner with them.

It is essential to make yourself stand out in the colossal crowd. Ensure your channel is unique and somewhat different from the rest because the contacted companies keep receiving partnering submissions from several other content creators too.

One important thing is not to send out the same old letter to all 50 companies and keep hoping to receive a positive response from at least one. Try to focus on your channel’s USP and highlight the same in your letter to the companies while trying to contact the companies for YouTube Sponsorship.

### 3\. Remember To Attend Exhibition

The trade shows and exhibitions are a great way to search for YouTube sponsorship for small channels. The exhibitions that focus on new media give a huge platform for you to find a sponsor when you participate in it.

Such events offer tricks and tips, helps you to talk to other content creators, and also lets you connect with the brand managers who can offer your channel with YouTube sponsorship.

## Part 3: Types of Sponsorship

#### 1\. Product Sponsorships

When you are searching for sponsorship for a particular product, ensure that it is relevant to your channel. Never approach the sponsors without ensuring the same as you might put off your viewers and your sponsors will not achieve their expected results. You might lose both your sponsors and audiences in such a case.

When you try to get YouTube sponsorship for small channels, it is quite difficult as the promotion of the product becomes limited to whatever small following they have. Product reviews and tutorials are the best ways to obtain product sponsorships.

### 2\. Paid Sponsorship

Among all sponsorships, paid sponsorship is the most challenging one. Usually, when you review the products of the affiliate links in your videos, you earn revenues, but, in the paid sponsorship you earn by advertising product and company links on your channel.

When you add the company’s products to your videos, you earn money. It appears at the beginning and at the end of your videos after it is played on your YouTube channel.

### 3\. Affiliate Sponsorship

It is the easiest of all sponsorships but also the least revenue-generating one too. Affiliate sponsorship works by sharing affiliate codes and links. It is used by your audiences to obtain discounts or offer you a reward.

There are two types in which affiliate sponsorship works. One is the discounting option where the code is shared and the viewers use these codes to get discounts anywhere between 5-15% in shopping products from that same site. Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.

## Conclusion

Not just the popular channels, the newbies can also earn YouTube sponsorship when they know the way outs. Follow the above tricks to get the youtube sponsorship for small channels without much effort. If your content is unique and your process to reach the sponsors is right, you can definitely make money through this medium. If you want to edit a YouTube video, Filmora can help you with its powerful features.

Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if you’re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.
