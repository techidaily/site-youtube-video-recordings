 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 29, 2020 

You surely have watched many well-plotted flash animations/videos or created one to be streamed onto the internet. And you inevitably can't resist  downloading those hilarious flash video clips on the website, like Grumpy Cat, and watching them offline at your desire. Or it may always intrigue your interest to discuss serious events over a free downloaded flash news video from New York Times. Since there are varied ways to stream flash videos online, different methods are thus required for **flash video free download**.

**\[Warning\] YouTube music & copyright-protected contents are not supported for download.**

## Download Flash Videos That Are HTTP-Based Streams

HTTP refers to the protocol used to deliver web pages and images across the WWW. videos served by HTTP can be cached by the web browser in its temporary storage, which makes it lack of security/IP protection so that viewers can still have access to those videos even if the browser is closed. At this point, you can download those flash videos directly and easily with a given URL in hand. So here, we recommend you two approaches:

First, use [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/). 5KPlayer is a mixture of a [Flash Video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and downloader. With a URL provided, it helps you free download HTTP-based flash video streams from Vimeo, VEVO, Dailymotion, Hulu and other over 300 video sharing websites alike and play them in any resolution up to 4K 8K with lossless quality.

Second, resort to free flash video download websites, like KeepVid. This download website works similar with 5KPlayer as it requires a URL. However, just as most online websites, many ads will disturb you from making the right move. Do make sure that you click the very "Download" button to free download the flash vidoes. Also, be sure that you have got a FLV player already.

## Download Flash Videos That Are RTMP-Based Streams

RTMP, aka. Real Time Messaging Protocol is a network control protocol (proprietary/partial public) used to stream audio/video content and data over the internet and control the two terminals –client and server. It is specialized and preferred by those content producers and licensees as it obtains enhanced IP protection.   
 If you find a flash video that cannot be directly downloaded by 5KPlayer or KeepVid, chances are it is a RTMP stream. In this case, we also provide two methods:

First, make good use of 5KPlayer. Another feature of 5KPlayer is that it can record screen. This process is pretty simple: Connect the iDevice and your 5KPlayer-installed PC/Mac the same WIFI network then mirror the iDevic's screen to the computer. A recording button provided by 5KPlayer will show up to help record your whole screen and the flash videos playing on it. 

Second, you can resort to fee-based Orbit Downloader to solve your flash video downloading problem. _Orbit Downloader_ has its free trial version, which only allows you to download first 50% of a flash video.
