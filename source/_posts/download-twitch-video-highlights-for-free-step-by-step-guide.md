## How to Download Twitch Videos from Live Stream & VODs?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last updated: August 27, 2020 | 3 Min Read_

If you wonder the popularity of a game, you can go to Twitch.tv to see if there are various corresponding broadcasters and viewers. Twitch.tv is well-known for its live streaming services, but it is also available for everyone to **download Twitch videos and clips**.

However, there are two different situations. If you are a regular user of Twitch, you only have up to 14 days to save your past broadcasts before the videos are deleted from the Twitch’s server. While for Twitch Partners, Turbo and Prime users, they have 60 days. What does it mean? It means, registered or unregistered, you have up to 2 months to download Twitch videos and clips.

It’s quite easy to download your own Twitch streams you broadcasted, but how about those from others? Here provides several free ways to get Twitch live streams and VODs quickly as a charm.

### How to Download Twitch Videos from Others?

Twitch videos are mainly classified to two categories: Esports and Music, from which you can find live streams, videos and clips of video gaming, game talk-shows, DJ songs, etc. After some tests, I have found that you can’t use the same way to download clips, videos and live streams. Hence, here will tell different ways for you to download different types of Twitch videos for your preference.

#### **![](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/../seoimg/1.png) How to Download Twitch Clip to MP4? No Third-party Help Needed**

**Step 2.** Tap the F12 key on your keyboard or right-click on the playing clip to choose Inspect.  
**Step 3.** Now, you are on the HTML interface. Click the "phone" icon > "Network" > "funnel" > tap mp4 in the "Filter" box > refresh the webpage > you will get an .mp4 link.  
**Step 4.** Copy the .mp4 video URL and paste it into the browser address bar of your Chrome and hit Enter. Then, the video will be saved to your computer directly.

#### **![](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/../seoimg/2.png) How to Download Twitch Videos?**

If you use the above way to find the [Twitch video URL](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), you won’t get the .mp4 video link but .m3u8 or .ts links. Don’t worry, you can also use such kinds of links to get Twitch videos.

**Part 1\. Directly stream Twitch videos via .m3u8 URL without download.**

**Step 1.** Do the same as mentioned above to find Twitch .m3u8 URL: Open the Twitch video that you want to download > tap F12 on your keyboard to access the HTML interface > click the "phone" icon > "Network" > "funnel" > tap m3u8 in the "Filter" box > refresh the webpage > you will get the .m3u8 link.  
**Step 2.** Free download 5KPlayer, install and launch it on your computer.  
**Step 3.** Click on the "Live" icon on the main UI of 5KPlayer, copy the .m3u8 link you just find and paste it into the "Input a URL" box of 5KPlayer, and hit Play to start playback.

No need to download, this way allows you to enjoy Twitch videos without occupying the computer storage. But if you want to do some further processing to the certain Twitch video, you are suggested to download Twitch videos. You can use the [M3U8 downloader](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) to download the Twitch video through the .m3u8 URL or use the following ways to download videos clips from Twitch.

**Part 2\. Merge the .ts file to download a Twitch video to MP4.**

As a matter of fact, Twitch is a live streaming service so that it adopt the M3U8 HLS streaming method to its broadcastings so as to ensure the fluency of every broadcast. And an .m3u8 file often contains of list of .ts files. So, if you can find all the .ts file, you can get a complete Twitch video with a help of video merger.

**Step 1.** Do as above to find the .ts links. You will see that there is a list of .ts file staring from number 0\. (Often the case you will see 0.ts, 1.ts, 2.ts, 3.ts, 4.ts, 5.ts, ……).  
**Step 2.** Copy the .ts link (like _https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/d5276ea7d5f59a08bcb2\_fresnorock\_39387686606\_1598138693/360p30/0.ts_) one by one to the address bar of your browser to download all the .ts files.  
**Step 3.** Get a video joiner like [WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/winxvideo-ai/), and then input all the .ts files to the joiner to let it merge into one video. Then, you will get your Twitch video.

However, this way is very time-consuming that it is only for information purpose. Besides, you have to remember the order of all the downloaded .ts files so that the final video will be played in the correct order.

**Part 3\. Download Twitch Videos with Twitch Leecher Software.**
