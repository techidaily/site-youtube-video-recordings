An independent streaming video downloader, boosting nice downloading speed and [flexible output format choice of MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/), MP4 and more, guarantees higher level of stability and safety than the lightweight browser-based video download websites.

[video download websites ->>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/)  
[video recording software ->>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/)

**How to Download Streaming Video with 3rd Party Streaming Video Downloader Software?** 

\- Compared to the browser-based video download websites like Keepvid or [the video recording software](https://lentrepreneurenvous.com/logiciel-enregistrement-ecran/), indepedent streaming video downloaders prove to be the most preferred choice featuring reliable performance and enclosed recording zone available. Often such 3rd party downloaders charges from $5.99 to above $30, while we discovered a newborn freeware -[5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), to run at excellent downloading speed and to [download 4K/5K/8K UHD videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) up to 73 output format available, it's built-in downloading kernel proves to be as robust as paid commercial video downloaders, fully tested by its utility in downloading 8K videos.

Moreover, you have to sacrifice the video stream downloading speed, that the recording speed is throttled for other webpages you opened would share bandwidth, unlike an independent streaming video downloader that works confined only to your maximal broadband speed.

**How to Record Streaming Video on YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix and more?**

The ultimate solution of streaming video downloading and recording. There's just nothing that a Video Converter Pro for Mac or Windows can't do.  
 \- It surpasses the above method of analyzing and downloading the streaming videos, which is somewhat like extracting a streaming video file, instead it [records your computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) at OS level, also enabling you to enclose a cetain video streaming playback area to record.  
 Now compared to the independent video streaming downloader 5KPlayer, the Video Converter Pro features powerful conversion functions in regard of streaming video formats, turning the html 4/5 YouTube video you just downloaded into the format that plays on iPhone/iPad, Android devices, Surface Pro 3 and more, while you have to keep the recording windows at top, unlike 5KPlayer which continues streaming video downloading whilst your doing Photoshops.
