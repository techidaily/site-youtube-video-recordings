## **Part 3\. How YouTube's New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators**

The new monetization rules for YouTube 2023 create a unique opportunity for creators to make money. The requirements to get monetized on YouTube are now relaxed. This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.

### **Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023**

Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.

![shorts revenue sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG)

Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.

### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.

[YouTube copyright](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) rules might not always seem fair, but they are in place for a reason. If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.

* [What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One](#part1)
* [Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video](#part2)

## Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?

YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don't own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.

If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.

Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.

In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.

## Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video

If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.

First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.

Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you've already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.

YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.

The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.

In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.

You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.

Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.

After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer. There is no risk involved in disputing a copyright claim; your video has already been flagged. In the worst case scenario, your video will remain flagged.

Usually with the help of an official license or direct permission from the content creator you can file a dispute with YouTube and receive an answer. If the dispute process is successful your video will be reinstated to the original uploaded version without blocked sound or content.

Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.

In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.

## Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video

If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.

First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.

Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you've already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.

YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.

The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.

In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.

You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.

Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.

After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer. There is no risk involved in disputing a copyright claim; your video has already been flagged. In the worst case scenario, your video will remain flagged.

Usually with the help of an official license or direct permission from the content creator you can file a dispute with YouTube and receive an answer. If the dispute process is successful your video will be reinstated to the original uploaded version without blocked sound or content.
