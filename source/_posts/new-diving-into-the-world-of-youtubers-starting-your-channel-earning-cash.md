### 2\. How Do I Find My Playlist On YouTube?

The YouTube Music Replay Mix playlist is located on the home screen of the YouTube Music app and website under the **"Mixed for you"** header. Here you can also find other playlists, including **"Your likes," "New Release Mix," "My Supermix,"** and **"Discover Mix."**

### 3\. How Do I Add Songs To The Replay Mix Playlist?

You can't manually add songs to the Replay Mix because YouTube Music automatically adds tracks that you listen to more than once.

The more often you hear a soundtrack, the higher it will appear on the YouTube list. Conversely, songs you've only played once or twice will appear lower on the list.

### 4\. How Do I Delete A Mix Playlist On YouTube?

To delete a **saved YouTube playlist** from the Music library:

* Launch YouTube Music app on your mobile device or head to its website on your computer.
* Tap **"Library"** on the home screen or homepage and tap the **"Mix"** you want to delete.
* Tap the**"More"** option on the playlist panel and tap **"Remove Playlist From Library."**

### 6\. Are YouTube Mixes Endless?

YouTube Music offers an endless personalized music playlist called **"My Mixes."** Every time you click or tap the playlist, a new queue of your most listened or favorite tracks is generated for you.

The playlist contains about 100 songs with an endless auto-play feature once you reach the end of the list.
