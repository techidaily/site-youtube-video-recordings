Your YouTube outro, or [end screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), is your last chance to keep a viewer on your channel. There are a lot of videos in the ‘Related’ sidebar that might catch their attention, or they could decide to go back to their search results.

A good outro will prompt viewers to keep watching related content from you instead of from someone else, and it could even convince them to subscribe.

2. [YouTube Outro Templates](#templates)
3. [How to Use YouTube’s End Screen Feature](#howto)
4. [How YouTube Outros/End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube](#grow)

## Part 1: YouTube Outro Basics

_From the video above we can see that it features video recommendations and a prominent subscribe button._

A YouTube end screen might have the following features:

**Videos:** you can embed links/thumbnails for videos you’ve made on similar topics in order to keep viewers watching your content.

**Playlists:** instead of (or in addition to) linking to individual videos, you can embed playlists and link viewers to all of your content on a particular topic.

**Subscribe Button:** prompt viewers to subscribe to your channel.

**Background:** you may choose to use all of the elements described above in combination with an end card consisting of a moving background or still image. You can even find [templates](#templates) that will have slots for all your thumbnails and buttons.

You may also want to include **social icons and handles** for your accounts on sites like Instagram or Twitter. These won’t be clickable (you’ll need to add them yourself outside of YouTube’s end screen tool), but they’ll still let viewers know where else they can find and follow you.

## Part 2: YouTube Outro Templates Download

Here are 4 sites where you can download templates for YouTube Outros:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Tube Arsenal Outro template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubearsenal-outro-template.jpg)

**Tube Arsenal:** this site has a good selection of customizable outros with moving backgrounds. On the Tube Arsenal site, before you download, you can adjust the colors and text included in your outro and even load in your own logo.

You can preview your customized outro by clicking Preview Still or Preview Movie.

Outros on Tube Arsenal cost $9 for 720P or $13 for 1080p.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Outro Maker Templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Outro Maker:** you can get animated end screens/outros from Outro Maker for $2.99 a month (or, if you just need one outro, you can probably finish it during your 7-day free trial).

Outro Maker uses the content already uploaded onto your channel to create your outro, so you will need to link the service with your channel.

![Biteable Outro Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/biteable-outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Biteable:** the templates you can customize on Biteable are not specifically designed to be YouTube Outros and will not have slots for your end screen elements. The videos start out a lot longer than you’ll want for an end screen (an end screen can’t last longer than 20 seconds), but you can shorten them by deleting all the ‘scenes’ you don’t need and keeping just the one or two you want.

The clips you can get from Biteable look great, and their process for changing the text and colors is simple and intuitive.

You can create 5 free projects every month with Biteable, but you’ll need to upgrade to their paid service to download them. It’s $30 for one month.

![Velosofy Outro Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/velosofy-outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Velosofy:** this site has a decent selection of templates you can download for free. However, the downloads are all project files for programs like Adobe Photoshop or After Effects. You’ll need to have the program that goes with your download in order to customize your outro.

You can also find free outro templates by searching for them on YouTube! Lots of people have created free outros to share with the YouTube community.

Besides downloading outro templates from the website, you can also create it with some [outro makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or with the video editing software that you are using. [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the video editor that I used often, it is featured some cool templates and preset for making an outro. I recommend you try it as well.

## Part 3: How to Use YouTube’s End Screen Feature

Make sure to create a space at the end of your video for the elements of your end screen to sit on top of. Your end screen will not add to the length of your video, it will overlay onto the last 5-20 seconds.

Here’s how you add an End Screen:

1. Go to your **YouTube Studio**, then switch to **Videos** on the left menu;
2. Click **Details** next to the video you want to add an end screen to.
3. Click the **End screen** in the menu under the lower right window.
4. Click **Element** to start adding videos, playlists, and subscribe buttons to your outro. You could also choose to use the same layout as a previous end screen with **Import From Video**, or you could apply multiple elements at once with a **YouTube Template**.
5. Drag the elements to where you want them and adjust the timing using the timeline.
6. Click **Save** when you’re done.

## Part 4: How YouTube Outros/End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube

One of the most important statistics for measuring the growth of Your YouTube channel is Watch Time. You need 4,000 hours of watch time (over the past 12 months) in order to qualify for monetization/the YouTube Partner Program, and watch time also plays an important role in how your videos are ranked in YouTube’s search results.

Watch time is more important than views. If you’re getting views, but people are only watching short sections of your video, YouTube’s algorithm thinks the people who are clicking on your videos don’t like them and ranks them lower.

Outros are one of the best ways of increasing the watch time for your channel, because the whole point of an outro is to convince viewers to stick around and watch more videos. Here are some best practices:

**Link to related videos and playlists**: if someone has watched one video on a topic to the end, they’ll likely be interested in another highly related video from you. For example, someone who’s watched a Let’s Play for God of War is more likely to be interested in another God of War video than your review of your new gaming headset.

**Link to your newest video:** YouTube’s algorithm places the most weight on the data it collects about your video within the first 24 hours of it being listed as Public. To give your newest video it’s the best chance at success, you should do everything you can to boost its watch time when it’s first posted and linking to it in the end screens of all your other videos is one way to do that.

You don’t have to change every screen individually, YouTube lets you link to your most recent video automatically.

**Link to Playlists:** if you can get a viewer watching a playlist of related videos then that’s great for your watch time. If they’re already in a playlist they’re far more likely to watch multiple videos than if they have to go to your channel page and hunt down the content they’re interested in.

**Include a ‘CTA’ with your subscribe button:** besides just including a button people can use to subscribe, you should ask them to click on it with a ‘Call to Action’ or CTA. This can mean writing something like ‘Subscribe for more videos!’ on your end card, or asking them in an outro voiceover. People are more likely to subscribe if you ask than if you don’t.

Are you using a YouTube outro? What elements do you include, and how do you think it’s helped the growth of your channel?

## Part 4: How YouTube Outros/End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube

One of the most important statistics for measuring the growth of Your YouTube channel is Watch Time. You need 4,000 hours of watch time (over the past 12 months) in order to qualify for monetization/the YouTube Partner Program, and watch time also plays an important role in how your videos are ranked in YouTube’s search results.

Watch time is more important than views. If you’re getting views, but people are only watching short sections of your video, YouTube’s algorithm thinks the people who are clicking on your videos don’t like them and ranks them lower.

Outros are one of the best ways of increasing the watch time for your channel, because the whole point of an outro is to convince viewers to stick around and watch more videos. Here are some best practices:

**Link to related videos and playlists**: if someone has watched one video on a topic to the end, they’ll likely be interested in another highly related video from you. For example, someone who’s watched a Let’s Play for God of War is more likely to be interested in another God of War video than your review of your new gaming headset.

**Link to your newest video:** YouTube’s algorithm places the most weight on the data it collects about your video within the first 24 hours of it being listed as Public. To give your newest video it’s the best chance at success, you should do everything you can to boost its watch time when it’s first posted and linking to it in the end screens of all your other videos is one way to do that.

You don’t have to change every screen individually, YouTube lets you link to your most recent video automatically.

**Link to Playlists:** if you can get a viewer watching a playlist of related videos then that’s great for your watch time. If they’re already in a playlist they’re far more likely to watch multiple videos than if they have to go to your channel page and hunt down the content they’re interested in.

**Include a ‘CTA’ with your subscribe button:** besides just including a button people can use to subscribe, you should ask them to click on it with a ‘Call to Action’ or CTA. This can mean writing something like ‘Subscribe for more videos!’ on your end card, or asking them in an outro voiceover. People are more likely to subscribe if you ask than if you don’t.

Are you using a YouTube outro? What elements do you include, and how do you think it’s helped the growth of your channel?

Your YouTube outro, or [end screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), is your last chance to keep a viewer on your channel. There are a lot of videos in the ‘Related’ sidebar that might catch their attention, or they could decide to go back to their search results.

A good outro will prompt viewers to keep watching related content from you instead of from someone else, and it could even convince them to subscribe.

## Part 1: YouTube Outro Basics

_From the video above we can see that it features video recommendations and a prominent subscribe button._

A YouTube end screen might have the following features:

**Videos:** you can embed links/thumbnails for videos you’ve made on similar topics in order to keep viewers watching your content.

**Playlists:** instead of (or in addition to) linking to individual videos, you can embed playlists and link viewers to all of your content on a particular topic.

**Subscribe Button:** prompt viewers to subscribe to your channel.

**Background:** you may choose to use all of the elements described above in combination with an end card consisting of a moving background or still image. You can even find [templates](#templates) that will have slots for all your thumbnails and buttons.

You may also want to include **social icons and handles** for your accounts on sites like Instagram or Twitter. These won’t be clickable (you’ll need to add them yourself outside of YouTube’s end screen tool), but they’ll still let viewers know where else they can find and follow you.

## Part 2: YouTube Outro Templates Download

Here are 4 sites where you can download templates for YouTube Outros:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Tube Arsenal Outro template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubearsenal-outro-template.jpg)

**Tube Arsenal:** this site has a good selection of customizable outros with moving backgrounds. On the Tube Arsenal site, before you download, you can adjust the colors and text included in your outro and even load in your own logo.

You can preview your customized outro by clicking Preview Still or Preview Movie.

Outros on Tube Arsenal cost $9 for 720P or $13 for 1080p.

![Outro Maker Templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Outro Maker:** you can get animated end screens/outros from Outro Maker for $2.99 a month (or, if you just need one outro, you can probably finish it during your 7-day free trial).

Outro Maker uses the content already uploaded onto your channel to create your outro, so you will need to link the service with your channel.

![Biteable Outro Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/biteable-outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Biteable:** the templates you can customize on Biteable are not specifically designed to be YouTube Outros and will not have slots for your end screen elements. The videos start out a lot longer than you’ll want for an end screen (an end screen can’t last longer than 20 seconds), but you can shorten them by deleting all the ‘scenes’ you don’t need and keeping just the one or two you want.

The clips you can get from Biteable look great, and their process for changing the text and colors is simple and intuitive.

You can create 5 free projects every month with Biteable, but you’ll need to upgrade to their paid service to download them. It’s $30 for one month.

![Velosofy Outro Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/velosofy-outro-maker-template.jpg)

**Velosofy:** this site has a decent selection of templates you can download for free. However, the downloads are all project files for programs like Adobe Photoshop or After Effects. You’ll need to have the program that goes with your download in order to customize your outro.

You can also find free outro templates by searching for them on YouTube! Lots of people have created free outros to share with the YouTube community.

Besides downloading outro templates from the website, you can also create it with some [outro makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or with the video editing software that you are using. [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the video editor that I used often, it is featured some cool templates and preset for making an outro. I recommend you try it as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 3: How to Use YouTube’s End Screen Feature

Make sure to create a space at the end of your video for the elements of your end screen to sit on top of. Your end screen will not add to the length of your video, it will overlay onto the last 5-20 seconds.

Here’s how you add an End Screen:

1. Go to your **YouTube Studio**, then switch to **Videos** on the left menu;
2. Click **Details** next to the video you want to add an end screen to.
3. Click the **End screen** in the menu under the lower right window.
4. Click **Element** to start adding videos, playlists, and subscribe buttons to your outro. You could also choose to use the same layout as a previous end screen with **Import From Video**, or you could apply multiple elements at once with a **YouTube Template**.
5. Drag the elements to where you want them and adjust the timing using the timeline.
6. Click **Save** when you’re done.

## Part 4: How YouTube Outros/End Screens Can Help You Grow on YouTube

One of the most important statistics for measuring the growth of Your YouTube channel is Watch Time.

## Free Intro Makers

Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.

This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.

What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and [Velosofy](#velosofy).

#### [Movietools](http://www.movietools.info/)

This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.

You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and/or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.

Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.

#### [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

 For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.

A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.

Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.

In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.

The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word/line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.

Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.

#### [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.

Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is [Blender](#blender), the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.

## 5 Tips for Making a Great Intro

Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.

#### 1\. Keep it Under 10 Seconds

Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.

Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.

#### 2\. Match Your Channel’s Branding

Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.

Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.

#### 3\. Use Music

Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.

#### 4\. Include Your Channel Name

This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.

#### 5\. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro

Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.

 What's your YouTube intro like? Can you think of a way you'd like to change or improve it?

This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.

You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and/or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.

Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.

#### [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

 For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.

A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.

Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.

In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.

The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word/line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.

Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.

#### [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.

Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is [Blender](#blender), the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.

## 5 Tips for Making a Great Intro

Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.

#### 1\. Keep it Under 10 Seconds

Someone who doesn’t know you, who is shopping around for the best video to watch on a particular topic, will not have the patience to sit through a long intro. In order to stop them from clicking away, you’ll need to keep your intro short. Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.

Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.

#### 2\. Match Your Channel’s Branding

Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.

Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.

#### 3\. Use Music

Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.

#### 4\. Include Your Channel Name

This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.

#### 5\. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro

Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.

 What's your YouTube intro like? Can you think of a way you'd like to change or improve it?

An intro video goes a long way towards building your brand and showing viewers that you’re serious about YouTube. Here’s where you can make or download intros, plus some tips on making intros that support the growth of your channel.

1. [4 Free Intro Makers](#makers)
2. [5 Tips for Making Great Intros](#tips)

## Free Intro Makers

Here’s a list of 4 places you can create or download FREE YouTube intros with no watermark.

#### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a free, open-source, ‘3D creation suite’. It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.

This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.

What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and [Velosofy](#velosofy).
