## How to Download Twitch Videos from Live Stream & VODs?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last updated: August 27, 2020 | 3 Min Read_

If you wonder the popularity of a game, you can go to Twitch.tv to see if there are various corresponding broadcasters and viewers. Twitch.tv is well-known for its live streaming services, but it is also available for everyone to **download Twitch videos and clips**.

However, there are two different situations. If you are a regular user of Twitch, you only have up to 14 days to save your past broadcasts before the videos are deleted from the Twitch’s server. While for Twitch Partners, Turbo and Prime users, they have 60 days. What does it mean? It means, registered or unregistered, you have up to 2 months to download Twitch videos and clips.

It’s quite easy to download your own Twitch streams you broadcasted, but how about those from others? Here provides several free ways to get Twitch live streams and VODs quickly as a charm.

### How to Download Your Twitch Past Broadcasts?

**Step 1\. Enable "Store past broadcasts":** Open twitch.tv website, and click on your account on the top right corner of the screen. From the drop-down menu, click on "Settings".

Then, all of your broadcasts will be saved to your profile once they finish.

### How to Download Twitch Videos from Others?

Twitch videos are mainly classified to two categories: Esports and Music, from which you can find live streams, videos and clips of video gaming, game talk-shows, DJ songs, etc. After some tests, I have found that you can’t use the same way to download clips, videos and live streams. Hence, here will tell different ways for you to download different types of Twitch videos for your preference.

And an .m3u8 file often contains of list of .ts files. So, if you can find all the .ts file, you can get a complete Twitch video with a help of video merger.

**Step 2.** Copy the .ts link (like _https://dqrpb9wgowsf5.cloudfront.net/d5276ea7d5f59a08bcb2\_fresnorock\_39387686606\_1598138693/360p30/0.ts_) one by one to the address bar of your browser to download all the .ts files.
