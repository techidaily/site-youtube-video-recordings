**Link**\- This element helps in sending the users directly to your website. Although, Google has restricted other link addition in the video. In order to add, you must have an Adsense account and permit monetization.

## Part 3: How To Use Youtube Cards

YouTube Cards is more interactive. Users can add images and other linkes. Here are the steps.

* Click on the "Video Manager" tab.
* If you want to add cards, Click "Edit" tab under it. Then click “cards”.
* Choose the cards type you want to make on "Add Card" drop down menu.
* Click “create” button. Select the timeline. In the end, apply.

### The types of YouTube cards

* **Video or playlist**: links to other videos/the complete palylist on YouTube related or non-related to that specific videolinks to further purchase websites or specific product.
* **Channel**: promote another YouTube channel, one of the most common methods to collaborate with other YouTubers
* **Poll**: Encourage viewers to participate in a poll (vote)
* **Link**: links to a website which compliments whatever content is in the video.

### 4 Tips for Using YouTube Cards

**1\.** You might be used to pointing to the part of your screen where you intend to put an annotation, but when you use YouTube Cards they might switch locations depending on what device a viewer is watching on.

**2.** Use three or less cards per video. Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.

**3.** Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.

 **4.** The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.

## Conclusion

Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.

### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

![android comment filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-9.jpg)

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.
