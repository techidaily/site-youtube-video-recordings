## Download and Install Moviebox for iPhone 11 iOS 13 and Before

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 26, 2020 

Watching movies on iPhone/iPad becomes one of the biggest entertaining at home now, which makes Apps like Moviebox for iPhone 11/XS Max/XS/XR/X/8/7 become popular since it offers tons of classic movies and uploads new movies constantly. But here is a tricky thing, Apple has banned Moviebox app and not made its available in App store since iOS 8.1\. So if you want to install Moviebox on iPhone powered by iOS 13 and before without jailbreak, you'll have to find ways to go around it. 

1\. Open Safari and get into vshare.com  
2\. Scroll down and choose to install App.   
3\. Launch VShare App and then search for Moviebox app for iPhone in the search box.   
4\. Click to download Moviebox.  
The similar steps to install Moviebox for iPhone 11 and earlier through iOSemus, HipStore or Playbox HD, you just need to go to their official page and download the App first. 

**Note:** When you install Moviebox for iPhone 11, iOS 13 may tell you that it is an untrusted App developer, but don't worry, you just need to go **Settings > General > Profiles** and **Trust** Moviebox to enable it.   
For iOS 10, there is no Profile option under General, all you have to do is to tap **Device Management** instead and then tap **Law Press**, tap **Trust**. Now when you retune to the Home you will find the Movie box installed just fine. Tap the Moviebox App, and just give it a few seconds to process, you will then be able to watch movies with Moviebox on your iPhone 7\. 

  
But it's far from over, don't think you can now watch online movies on your iPhone with Moviebox without worries. 

_"I can't even watch a single movie on Moviebox without it freezing up every 2 seconds."_ 
_"It worked when I download Moviebox thru VShare yesterday but now it crashes every time I try to open it."_ 

The reason why the Moviebox app keeps crashing constantly is due to invalid certificates, but don't worry, Vshare, iOSemus and others do have their own ways to get new valid certificates for Moviebox and other Apple expired Apps. So you'll just have to reinstall every time it starts crashing and don't forget to go to Safari and then clear history and website data before redownloading Moviebox for iPhone X/8/7\. 

Don't you think it's a little bit pathetic using Moviebox for iPhone just for watching movies at leisure time? Although one problem shows up there is always a fix to pin it down, still, it drives you crazy if you have to reinstall Moviebox for iPhone every time it crashes. Aren't you considering to replace Moviebox for iPhone with the best free Moviebox alternative? 

There are pretty much enough tutorials or tutorial videos on YouTube showing you how to download and install Moviebox for iPhone with different iOS versions respectively. Some may work for a few users and some may not work at all. And most of them don't point out the problems you may bump into when you are following the tutorial. The newest tutorials of how to install Moviebox for iPhone are as follows.

## Install Moviebox for iPhone iOS

The answer is **NO**, no matter how hard you try, how many times you click the MP3 links, you cannot download MP3 with KeepVid directly from video sites like YouTube, Dailymotion, Vevo, etc.. Yes you can get the audio only file, but it's not in MP3\. But there are two ways to download YouTube MP3 with KeepVid regardless of the risk of the constant [KeepVid Virus](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) and Ads which you may accidently hit. 

## Install Moviebox for iPhone iOS 13 and Earlier

 You see Apple has killed Moviebox for iPhone since iOS 8.1, and the way to go around App store is to download Moviebox for iPhone through several other Apps like HipStore, VShares, iOSemus, Playbox HD etc. They are like another kind of App store where you can search and download Apps like Moviebox for iPhone and games which are not available in Apple's App store. 

One is to download M4A audio and convert it to MP3 with a KeepVid MP3 converter, the other way (May save the audio file in a better condition) is to download the whole video and then extract the MP3 audio. No matter which way you prefer, you'll need a third party KeepVid MP3 converter, here I recommend [Macx DVD video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and [Winx HD Video Converter Delux](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/winxvideo-ai/) if you still choose to download YouTube to MP3 with KeepVid in the indirect ways.
