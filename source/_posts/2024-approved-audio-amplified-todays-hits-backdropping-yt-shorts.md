First impressions matter, in real life and in the world of online content production. The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.

## The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.

#### 2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
