**\[Notice\]** Check out the copyright laws in your country & region before trying to download videos from HD anime sites.

**4\. [AnimeDao](https://animedao.com/) \-  HD Anime Download with Multiple Source of Videos**

![AnimeDao](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/animedao.jpg) 

As an anime lover, waiting for the updates every week is both a very anxious but desirable business. AnimeDao surprises us that it marks the very specific update time of the new animation, not only has been online but also has the update countdown to let you know the ongoing anime content. Isn't it exciting enough to know that your favorite anime will be updated within the next hour?

The least amount of ads, and the HD anime watching online experience is smooth and clean. AnimeDao also provides a discussion part under the website, you can leave your comment or vote for the emoji icon to express your attitude towards this anime.

**5\. NWANIME -  Commercial HD Anime Site**

![NWANIME](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/nwanime.jpg) 

Stable service providing HD anime videos, yet nwanime.com is indeed a more commercial option than motube.net: Visit this HD anime site and it's not difficult to find the real anime video thumbnails surrounded by pop-up ads and other sponsor's info. There are just all the basic anime watching options available on nwanime.com, but at least lately they don't have plans for more creative ideas. By the time I visit this HD anime website in September, one of the page-top navigation tabs - Clans, doesn't seem to engage much anime buffs there (might be a new service though).

**6\. [Gogoanime](https://www11.gogoanime.io/) \-  Watch anime online, English anime online HD**

![Gogoanime](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/gogoanime.jpg) 

Gogoanime is an ads-free online anime site provides download option for users. It provides really good watching experience such as various server choice and well-organized episodes, you can easily skip to the different server or episode. If you are a Naruto fan, you can see this is a Naruto themed anime website, and no matter which page you click and jump to on the site, you can find the lovely Naruto characters everywhere.

By the way, this HD anime site with very simple features focuses on providing anime content and information but does not have the community for anime fans. 

**7\. [AnimeLab](https://www.animelab.com/home) \-  Free fast-tracked anime from Japan+**

![AnimeLab](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/animelab.jpg) 

AnimeLab gives you a first impression that this is an HD anime site with bright and dazzling eye candies, and it has clearer information retrieval than many other sites and you can find the anime you want to watch according to different genres categories. 

AnimeLab provides basic and premium plans for you to choose, you can try its free trial or keep a free account if you do not mind the ads and one week delayed simulcasts.

**8\. WatchCartoonOnline -  HD Anime Site with Curator**

If this is your first visit to watchcartoononline.com, take it easy. This is an HD anime site with bright orange interface which some users just complain about a little. If this is not a problem for you, then stay with it, for this is really a free HD anime website with rich, instantly-updated, and subbed anime videos and episodes. We tend to believe that watchcartoononline is an HD anime website with its own curator, or at least a sound counting system, for you can always find some most-welcomed, HD anime episodes on the middle-right chart for "Today's Anime List". It also makes it quite easy for you to go by Dubbed, Cartoon, or Subbed type. That being said, the scientific sorting system really makes it one of the easiest-to-use HD anime sites.
