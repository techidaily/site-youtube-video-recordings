Microsoft Office 2016 has another lucrative feature that allows users to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint** by searching its name. You can follow the steps given below to find the videos published on YouTube, and insert them to your presentation:

**Step 1: Get to the Insert Video Box**

Use the process explained in **Step 2** of **Method 2** to get to the **Insert Video** box after selecting the slide you want to add a video to.

### Method 4: Insert Video from PC

Another method to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint** is by downloading the clip to your PC, and then inserting the footage from there. You can use any free YouTube downloader to obtain a video that is available on YouTube.

Once the file is on your computer, the following steps explain how it can be embedded to your PowerPoint slide:

**WARNING:** YouTube videos may be subject to copyright. Therefore, before downloading and embedding a video to your PowerPoint slide, make sure that you have proper rights to do so, or that the video can be used for the purpose without any written permission from its creator.

**Step 1: Get to the Insert Ribbon**

Open PowerPoint and select the slide you want to embed a YouTube video to. Go to **Insert** from the menu bar at the top.

**Step 2: Insert the Video**

Click the **Video** icon from the **Media** section of the Ribbon, click **Video on My PC** from the list, and use the **Insert Video** box that appears to select and insert the video to your PowerPoint slide.

**Step 3: Resize and/or Modify the Video**

Grab any of the six handles of the video you inserted, and drag it inward to decrease the size of the frame. It is advisable to use the corner handle and drag them diagonally to maintain proper aspect ratio of the player’s frame. Next, right-click anywhere inside the frame, click **Format Video** from the context menu, and use the options that appear in the right pane to make necessary adjustments to the clip like color correction, manage brightness and contrast, etc.

**Step 1: Copy the URL**

Open your default web browser, go to the YouTube video you want to embed to PowerPoint, and copy its URL from the address bar at the top.

**Step 2: Add URL to PowerPoint**

Another method to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint** is by downloading the clip to your PC, and then inserting the footage from there. You can use any free YouTube downloader to obtain a video that is available on YouTube.

Once the file is on your computer, the following steps explain how it can be embedded to your PowerPoint slide:

**WARNING:** YouTube videos may be subject to copyright. Therefore, before downloading and embedding a video to your PowerPoint slide, make sure that you have proper rights to do so, or that the video can be used for the purpose without any written permission from its creator.

**Step 1: Get to the Insert Ribbon**

Open PowerPoint and select the slide you want to embed a YouTube video to. Go to **Insert** from the menu bar at the top.

**Step 2: Insert the Video**

Click the **Video** icon from the **Media** section of the Ribbon, click **Video on My PC** from the list, and use the **Insert Video** box that appears to select and insert the video to your PowerPoint slide.

**Step 3: Resize and/or Modify the Video**

Grab any of the six handles of the video you inserted, and drag it inward to decrease the size of the frame. It is advisable to use the corner handle and drag them diagonally to maintain proper aspect ratio of the player’s frame. Next, right-click anywhere inside the frame, click **Format Video** from the context menu, and use the options that appear in the right pane to make necessary adjustments to the clip like color correction, manage brightness and contrast, etc.

## Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:
