## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

The first step is to decide on a business specialty. Prepare a list of the sectors you'll be covering in your films. It's easy for your thoughts to wander when you're trying to cover too many topics and niches. Pick a few appropriate niches based on your interests and/or experience. For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

#### \- Describe The Purpose of Your Channel

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things? Perhaps you simply wish to entertain others by sharing stories. Outline the goal you want to accomplish with your channel so that your videos have meaning. It will also help you get off to a good and consistent start rather than attempting to cover everything all at once.

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar
