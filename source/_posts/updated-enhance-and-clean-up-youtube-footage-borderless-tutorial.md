For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things?

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas
