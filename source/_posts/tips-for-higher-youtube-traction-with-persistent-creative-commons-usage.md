All you need to do is download a video background loop or motion element, or lower third templates from this free video loops website and then import it into the timeline of your video editor like Filmora, and then customize and add your own text and logo over it.

#### 11\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Blender is a **free**, open source 3D creation tool. But unlike Panzoid, you’ll have to download and run it from your computer. You can either create something from scratch or work off of templates that others have already made and shared over the internet.

#### 12\. [RendrFX](https://50wheel.com/rendrfx/)

The next on our list is RendrFX. With RendrFX, you can create and download up to three 1080p intro videos for free. As a free user, though, your intro videos will come with a watermark (not too big and just on the bottom right corner of your video). For every video you want the watermark removed, you will have to pay $24.99 USD.

Above are the top free online YouTube intro makers. You can use any one of these and make your intro videos look more impressive and effective. Please note some of these youtube intro makers are free to use but there will be a watermark in the output intro video. And to remove the watermark, you may need to subscribe or buy the service. So, you need to have a try first before devoting a lot of energy to the tool.
