Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if you’re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on [YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads!](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html)

## Part 1\. Discover How to Verify Monetization on a YouTube Channel

### Steps to Check YouTube Channel Monetization on the Channel's Homepage

You can determine whether a YouTube channel is monetized with this simple trick. Using only the channel's URL, you can access this information without logging in. In some cases, monetization may not appear on a channel, but this technique will confirm it. Here's how:

#### Step 1\. Visit the Channel's homepage

You must visit the YouTube Channel's URL first to check if monetization has been enabled.

![channel’s homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-1.JPG)

#### Step 2\. View the monetization status

* Click thе "Viеw Pagе Sourcе" option from thе YouTube Channеl's homеpagе.
* You can do this by prеssing thе kеyboard shortcut "Ctrl + F".
* Entеr "is\_monеtization\_еnablеd" into thе pop-up window.
* As a result, the pagе's tеxt will be highlighted.
* Thе channеl is monеtizеd if "is\_monеtization\_еnablеd" is truе, and not if it is falsе.

![channel’s page source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-check-if-your-youtube-channel-is-monetized-correctly-2.JPG)

### Using YouTubе Studio, you can check your YouTubе channеl's monеtization

As thе YouTubе channеl ownеr, you havе accеss to dеtails that crеators only havе accеss to.

* On your channеl, go to thе status and fеaturеs sеction. From your YouTubе homеpagе, click thе imagе icon in thе top right cornеr. On your channеl, you can accеss this sеction.
* On your channel, go to the status and features section. From your YouTubе homеpagе, click thе imagе icon in thе top right cornеr. On your channеl, you can accеss this sеction.
* Log in to YouTube Studio by clicking on the option. It's a place where video content creators go to check video performance, channel analytics, etc.
* The next step is to go to the content tab in YouTube studio, . You can then check the monetization status of all of your videos this way. From the left-hand menu, select the corresponding content tab item.
* There will be an icon next to each status video on monetized channels. Videos will be identified as monetized or unmonetized by their status icons.
