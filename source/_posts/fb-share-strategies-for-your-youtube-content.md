#### \- Emphasize on one key-point

#### \- Add a Call To Action

Including a call-to-action will encourage your viewers to subscribe to your channel. Ensure you include it at the end of your video to tell viewers what to do next. You could also include a link to your blog post to let your viewers read and find more content from your other channels.

#### \- Facebook ads can make a great difference

Facebook is a great place for running ads that reach a wider audience. Adverts are great ways to target a specific audience. They explain your products and services more straightforwardly.

#### \- Embed your videos on blog posts

Numerous people get to access guest posts and blog posts. You can embed your Facebook videos on such posts to reach more people. Just get the embed code from your video, then copy and paste it to a guest or blog post.
