## Part 3\. Monetizing YouTube channels on mobile devices: Some Proven Ways

It is beneficial for creators to use YouTube AdSense, although it is not a reliable source of income. The advertising rates fluctuate, so making the same amount of money every year is hard. At last, here are some methods for monetizing YouTube:

![ways for youtube monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Maximizing-Revenue-How-to-monetize-YouTube-Channel-on-Mobile-in-2023-6.JPG)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Ads on YouTube

Monetizing a website has many methods, but this is the most basic and straightforward one. Various YouTube ad formats provide control over ad placement before or during a video.

### Sponsorships that are paid

Sponsorship involves paying a content creator to use, demonstrate, or test a brand's product in a video. It benefits both the sponsors and the viewers when brands sponsor creators.

### Affiliates

Using affiliate programs is another way of monetizing your YouTube videos. With affiliate marketing, your audience is directed to a brand's landing page or product by clicking an affiliate link. A commission is earned when the user purchases successfully. It is possible to earn extra income through affiliate programs. Offer discounts to your followers when you become an affiliate for a product you already use.

### The merchandise

A similar tactic has already been discussed. Your fans can buy branded goods from a wide range of merchant platforms available today.
