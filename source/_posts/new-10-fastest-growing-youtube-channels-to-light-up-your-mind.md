 Select the video and click on edit to get a drop down menu. Click on subtitles and CC. Go to 'add subtitles' and then 'upload a file'. A pop-up menu will appear select 'subtitles file'. Click upload. The file will send subtitles to your video.

 This will create a subtitle timeline right beneath the video. You can manage by dragging and expanding the subtitle duration according to the audio of the video. The subtitle will appear at the bottom of the video screen. Click 'publish' once done.

## 3 Best Tools for add/managing video Subtitles/CC

#### 1\.  Amara

 Amara is a smart video editor which helps insert captions and subtitles to videos. It also helps in transcribing the videos. It takes help of crowd sourcing to subtitle any YouTube video. They take help from viewers to subtitle the videos. By making crowd subtitling available for any YouTube creator, they are allowing them to reach more viewers in more languages

#### 2\.  DIY Captions

 DIY captions help you to transcribe the YouTube videos, if not in most accurate manner, then in a little easier way. All you have to do is just paste the URL of the YouTube video and it will provide you all the subtitles. These may not be accurate but will provide you major base material which can be tweaked a bit here and there and is far better than making all the subtitles starting from scratch.

#### 3  Subtitles for YouTube

 Subtitles for YouTube is a Google Chrome extension which provides subtitles for YouTube videos. For this you will have to provide a subtitle file with .srt extension. The attractive feature of this is that you won't have to download the video and still run the subtitles on it. This is very much helpful for people who work on YouTube or watch movies without subtitles.
