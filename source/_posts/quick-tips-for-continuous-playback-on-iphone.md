## Part 3: How to Use AdSense for YouTube

### 1\. Finding Your Money in AdSense

Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.

First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.

In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: **Hosted AdSense for Content** and **AdSense for Content**. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on **Hosted AdSense for Content**.

![adsense performance report](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG)

The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel. Your earnings will be organized by date. The money you see in this report has already had YouTube’s 45% commission deducted.

### 2\. How are my earnings determined?

How much money you make through AdSense depends on your [CPMs](https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/) and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.

A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.

CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.

### 3\. How do I get paid?

There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.

Using **Western Union Quick Cash** you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.

**EFTs** get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.

**Checks** can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.

**Wire Transfers** and **Rapida** can each take up to 15 days.

![adsense payment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg)

In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100\. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month. You will receive your first payment after you earn $100.

## Conclusion

Making money with YouTube Adsense is one of the best media that is reliable, easy to use, and better than any other ways of creating money. With Adsense, you can create various size and kinds of ad units to add it to your website. Those ad spaces are filled by Google with the content and traffic relevant to your site. There are also some YouTuber influencer marketing platforms such as [InflueNex](https://www.influenex.com/), which enables YouTubers to learn about their own channels, their competitors' channels, and join the platform for establishing replationship with the brands.

## Part 3: How to Use AdSense for YouTube

### 1\. Finding Your Money in AdSense

Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.

First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.

In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: **Hosted AdSense for Content** and **AdSense for Content**. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on **Hosted AdSense for Content**.

![adsense performance report](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG)

The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel. Your earnings will be organized by date. The money you see in this report has already had YouTube’s 45% commission deducted.

### 2\. How are my earnings determined?

How much money you make through AdSense depends on your [CPMs](https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/) and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.

A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.

CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.

### 3\. How do I get paid?

There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.

Using **Western Union Quick Cash** you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.

**EFTs** get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.

**Checks** can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.

**Wire Transfers** and **Rapida** can each take up to 15 days.

![adsense payment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg)

In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100\. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month. You will receive your first payment after you earn $100.

## Conclusion

Making money with YouTube Adsense is one of the best media that is reliable, easy to use, and better than any other ways of creating money. With Adsense, you can create various size and kinds of ad units to add it to your website. Those ad spaces are filled by Google with the content and traffic relevant to your site. There are also some YouTuber influencer marketing platforms such as [InflueNex](https://www.influenex.com/), which enables YouTubers to learn about their own channels, their competitors' channels, and join the platform for establishing replationship with the brands.
