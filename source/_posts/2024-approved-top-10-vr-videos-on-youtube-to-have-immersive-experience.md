## Part 2: How to Add a Glowing Neon Border in Your YouTube Thumbnail with Canva

Canva is another intuitive editing program that works on the web interface rather than having you download and install an app on your PC. You can add a **neon border** for YouTube thumbnails using Canva by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Define Project Settings and Add a Background**

After signing in to your Canva account, click **Create a design** from the top-right corner of the page, click **Custom size** from the bottom, define **1280** and **720** in the **Width** and **Height** fields on the box that appears respectively, and click **Create new design**.

![add neon border to thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-neon-border-canva.jpg)

Now, click to select **Background** from the navigation bar on the left (if the **Background** tool is not visible, click **More** and then choose **Background** from the expanded list), and click to select a background from the images available in the center pane.

![choose background in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-choose-background.jpg)

**Step 2: Upload an Image and Add Effects**

Click **Uploads** from the navigation bar, click the **More** icon from the right of the **Upload media** button present at the top of the center pane, choose your preferred method to upload the image (with the transparent background) that you want to use, upload the image, and drag it from the center pane to the Canvas.

**Note:** You can use any of the tools available online to remove the background from your image for free.

![upload thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

To add a **YouTube thumbnail border**, make sure that the image that you added to the Canvas is selected, click the **Duplicate** icon from the upper-right area, and use the scaling handles of the copy of the image to increase its size a bit. Reposition the image back to its original location as well.

Then, click **Edit image** from the upper-left corner of the Canvas, click **Duotone** from the **Edit image** pane at the center, if need be, click **See all**, choose your preferred duotone effect to apply on the image, choose your preferred highlight and shadow colors from the box that appears next, and click **Back** from the top of the pane.

![Canva edit image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-edit-image-duotone.jpg)

Next, click **See all** next to the **Adjust** section from the center pane, and drag the **Blur** slider to the right to increase the blur effect on the image.

**Step 3: Position the Layers**

While keeping the duplicate image selected, click the **Position** button from the upper-right area of the Canvas, and click **Background** to send the second image behind the first one to get the **neon border** effect for the photo.

## Part 3: How to Outline a Person in a YouTube Thumbnail with Photoshop

Because YouTube thumbnails are nothing but static images, creating **YouTube thumbnail border** with Adobe Photoshop is comparatively easier. The process of doing this is given below:

**Step 1: Define Document Preferences and Import an Image**

Launch Adobe Photoshop on your PC, click **Create new**, and on the **New Document** customization box, define the width and height values to **1280** and **720** pixels respectively. Select **Transparent** from the **Background Contents** menu as well if not already selected. Click **Create** from the bottom to create a new Photoshop document with the specified document settings. Next, open the folder that contains the source image, drag the photo to Photoshop, and press **Enter** to place the photo.

![import thumbnail image to ps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-youtube-thumbnail-photoshop.jpg)

**Step 2: Remove Background from the Image**

Make sure that the image layer is selected in the **Layers** panel on the right, go to **Select** from the menu bar at the top, and click **Subject**. From the bottom of the **Layers** panel, click the **Add a mask** icon to get rid of the background, leaving only the human on the Canvas.

![remove thumbnail background in ps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-thumbnail-background.jpg)

**Step 3: Add a Custom Background and an Outline Around the Subject**

Use the method explained earlier to import a background image of your choice to Photoshop. Drag the background image layer to the bottom in the **Layers** panel. Double-click the masked layer, click to select **Stroke** from the left pane of the **Layer Style** box, and use the options available on the right to manage the size, color, position, etc. of the stroke that has been added around the human subject. Click **OK** when done, and then export the image normally to use it as a **YouTube thumbnail border**.

**Summary**

It is important to know that the default resolution of a YouTube thumbnail is 1280 x 720 pixels that is usually written and referred to as 720p. While adding a **YouTube thumbnail border**, it is also imperative to have a good sense of color combination and fonts. Furthermore, a decent tool like Wondershare Filmora X must be used to add an appealing **neon border** around the main subject in the thumbnail image easily and quickly.
