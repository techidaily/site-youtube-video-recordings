## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:
