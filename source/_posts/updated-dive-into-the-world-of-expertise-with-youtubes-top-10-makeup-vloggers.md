### [Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This is one of the simplest yet powerful tools that is lightweight and apt for your Mac. One of the perks of using the Filmora X is the feature that allows you to upload the video directly to YouTube, saving you any extended hassles.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There are also 400+ transition effects as well as a stylish text editor that is fun to use. There is also a built-in music and sound effect feature that enables you to select sounds to match the video you are editing. This is if you do not have the music you want for the video already.

Other pros of Filmora are:

• It has fast rendering sped for your video

• The lifetime price is affordable.

However, there are some disadvantages to the usage of Filmora X, which are:

• The free version contains the Filmora X watermark

• The color grading tool is limited.

## Blender

If you are looking for software for the model, game creating, and animation then opting for Blender will be a good fit. You can trim videos, insert filters, and add as many videos as you want.

Pros

* The 3D graphics make it suitable for editing YouTube videos.
* Composting system and node-based material
* It supports your Mac.

Cons:

* It could be slow when running
* Some think it might be a bit complicated.

Although there is other editing software for your Mac, [Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) simplifies the whole process. If you are looking for quality wrapped in affordability and convenience, then Filmora X will be right for you. Start editing and enjoy the ride!
