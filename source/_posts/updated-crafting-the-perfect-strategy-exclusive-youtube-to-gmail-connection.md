Want to share a private YouTube video? A private video is a video that is posted to YouTube, but only viewable to a select group of people who you choose to share it with. It could be that this is a personal video only intended for friends and family, or it could be that you want to get feedback from people you trust before making it public.

Private YouTube videos can be shared with 50 Google accounts.

* [**Part 3: How to Share Unlisted Videos on YouTube**](#unlisted)

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## **Part 1: How to Share a Private YouTube Video**

You can make a YouTube video private either within the Creator studio or by choosing the option when you first upload a video.

When you mark a video as private you will be able to send the video out to up to 50 e-mail addresses, names of contacts on Google, or your circles on Google plus. As soon as you add a new contact to the list they will receive an invite link to view the video.

Unlike with an unlisted video, the contacts allowed to view a private video will not be able to share the URL of your video with their own friends and contacts.

## **Part 2: Private Video Limitations on YouTube**

The video cannot be shared again and only the individuals invited can view the video at its URL.

 ![private video limitation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-limitation.gif)

 Contacts that you send the private invite too will have to have a YouTube account and be signed in to it, in order to view your video.

## **Part 3: How to Share Unlisted Videos on YouTube**

Another option that YouTube delivers for privacy is the chance to mark videos as unlisted. Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.

To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.

 Latest survey shows that Google’s video streaming site Youtube has surpassed radio, as well as CDs to be the most popular way American adolescents listen to music. Almost 91% of the music fans would listen to the samples before they purchase a song on iTunes. “Watching” music is getting more and more popular with Youtube’s arising popularity among music fans.

 However, here comes the dilemma if you are trying to share your favorite music list with your friends on Youtube since Youtube is not designed to host files that are purely audio. Only video files are allowed to be uploaded to its server. Despite all this, is there a safe and easy solution to this issue? The answer if absolutely Yes! [Wondershare audio converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) let you upload an MP3 to Youtube by converting them to videos files first without losing any of its quality, helping you remove the barrier of uploading audio files to Youtube.
