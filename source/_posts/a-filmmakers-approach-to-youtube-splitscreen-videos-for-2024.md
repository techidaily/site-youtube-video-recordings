If we talk about post-production techniques and visual effects, then [Split Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has to be one of the smartest picks. After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.

## Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos

Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.

* ### To draw a direct comparison

One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.

![split screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg)

* ### To provide two or more perspectives

Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.

One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.

* ### To implement the cloning effect

Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background. Later, we implement a split-screen effect in which both the clips are combined in such a way that it makes the audience believe as if the scene has both, the character and their clone placed flawlessly.

Many people don’t use emojis in their YouTube videos, fearing a negative impact. But all the rumors out there are just rumors without any truth. YouTube doesn’t penalize you in any way if you use emojis in comments, titles, or descriptions. You will not experience any penal actions by including emojis on YouTube.

Google is also friendly with emojis, and many websites use them to stand apart from the crowd. Using emojis on YouTube can be an excellent way to improve your SEO performance. Your videos will also have a chance to show up on Google results and YouTube. Emojis also help your videos look innovative to draw in more views.

**Final Thoughts**

Using emojis in YouTube comments is a great way to boost the popularity of your videos. You can also use emojis in your video titles and descriptions to appear more innovative. Additionally, emojis can improve your YouTube SEO performance and even help you rank on Google search results.

Copy-pasting emojis is a simple way to use them, but you can also go for other methods. TubeBuddy is a great choice if you want to eliminate the whole copy-paste scenario and include more types of emojis in your comments directly.
