![adsense pay per 1,000 views](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-1.jpg)

As a content creator, you might be tempted to know how much you can expect to earn through AdSense. Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.

### Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense

For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20\. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users' location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.

More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.

You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.

__Formula:__

[RPM = (Estimated earnings / Number of page views) \* 1000](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515)

From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that

Estimated earnings = (RPM \* Number of page views) / 1000

To understand it further, see the example below.

Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.

($0.10 / 25) \* 1000 = $6.00

Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00

($4.00 \* 45,000) / 1000 = $180.00

### AdSense Pay Per View

Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.

But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.

## Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?

![pay per click](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg)

After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.

On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher's earnings and competition among rival advertisers.

And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.

## Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples

From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.

Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.

Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:

* For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn __$5.62__ after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.
* Creators who create content on vehicles can earn __around $9.20__ on every 1,000 pageviews.
* If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn __up to $13.01__ on 1,000 pageviews.
* For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn __$14.50, $17.40__, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.

Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.

## Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider

After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.

### 1) Type of Content

To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.

For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.

While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.

As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.

Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.

![adsense calculator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg)

And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2) Keywords

Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product. The ones you choose will help show your ads to users.

Therefore, go for the relevant yet high-quality keywords and add them to your ad campaigns. This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.

### 3) User Location

Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.

Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.

### 4) Time Requires to Get Views

There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.

The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.

Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.

More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.

And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5) Video Duration

Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.

However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.

### 6) Your Niche or Industry

Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings. Some of the profitable topics are:

* Business
* Investment
* Health
* Insurance
* Online Marketing

You can choose the area that interest you the most and start people educating about it.

For example, people tend to think about investing their money to multiply it. You can create videos on investment-related topics, tips and tricks to get maximum views.

The free version of Fotor will work well enough for most YouTubers, but you can also upgrade to their paid Pro program to unlock more content and features.

YourTube has a ton of really nice looking channel art templates you can download for free. The downloads include both PSD (Photoshop) files and the background images without text. This is great because you’ll have an editable file you can build on in Photoshop, if you have it, and an image file you can use in combination with a free service like Canva if you don’t.

## 7\. [Banner Snack](https://www.bannersnack.com/youtube.html)

Banner Snack is for all kinds of social media graphics from YouTube channel art to Twitter headers. It’s a high quality service that’s been used by a lot of major brands, like Lego and Xerox. The only downside of Banner Snack is that their free service is limited and has a watermark. You need to be paying at least $7 per month in order to get rid of the watermark.

Let us know if you know anywhere else to get free YouTube channel art templates!
