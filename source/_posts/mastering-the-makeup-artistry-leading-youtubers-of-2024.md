Instead of browsing through thousands of beauty videos on YouTube, you should listen to what top beauty gurus on YouTube have to say about the topic you're interested in. The beauty vloggers we featured in this article have millions of subscribers for a good reason.

Zoe is better known for her online pseudonym Zoella. She started her career as a blogger in 2009\.

Besides being one of the most influential beauty gurus on YouTube Jeffrey Steininger is also a songwriter, singer, fashion designer, and model. He first rose to prominence by publishing music on his MySpace page, which soon resulted in his first solo album 'Beauty Killer'.

His style may be unorthodox since it resonates better within a younger, more open-minded audience, but the makeup tips he provides in his videos can be used by anyone to get the look they always wanted. Jeffree Star's YouTube channel has 7.4 million subscribers which shows just how popular this Californian really is. Jeffry also has his own fashion and cosmetics line.
