The [YouTube Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an essential aspect of managing a successful channel (click here to learn more about the [Analytics section of your Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Using the tools available in the Creator studio you can manage your videos, interact with your audience, and keep track of important video statistics.

The Creator Studio’s interface is customizable so you can add or remove widgets based on the tools that you most commonly use.

On the main dashboard of the Creator Studio, you will see a menu that includes your video manager, live streaming support, community page, channel page, analytics, translations, and transcriptions.

Also on the dashboard, you can see analytics for the most successful videos that you have posted.

## Adjusting the Dashboard

Pinning new charts to the dashboard will ensure that all of the data you need most often is easily viewable upon first entering the Creator Studio. All you need to do to add new widgets to the dashboard sidebar is to use the **add widget** feature.

Making adjustments to your current widgets simply involves clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner to add custom tiles as well as rearrange the order of the various widgets that you have selected.

## YouTube Creator Studio Tools

**Video Manager:** from the Video Manager section you can view any of the videos that you have posted to YouTube. This menu includes all of your uploaded videos whether they are public, unlisted, or private. You can see advanced statistics on every one of the videos you posted as well as download MP4s of your videos for re-editing. The video manager allows you to very quickly select multiple videos and then add them to a playlist.

**Live streaming**: YouTube has made it easy for anyone with a verified account to go live. There are even special monetization features specifically for live streaming. Streaming is especially vital to the gaming genre on YouTube.

**Analytics:** the analytic section is essential to your success as a video creator. Through analytics, you can see which of your videos are most successful in terms of watch time, views, or monetization and you can even check how many new subscribers individual videos are attracting to your channel. This information is important because once you know what’s working you can keep doing it and start growing your channel faster.

Other information you can access through your Creator Studio includes the demographics (nationality, gender, age) of your viewers, video comments, your subscriber list, and any information related to copyright strikes.

How many times a week do you check your stats in the YouTube Creator Studio?

The device includes unlimited game capture at a fairly reasonable price and a creation suite so that you can do multitrack recording from your webcam.

The software that comes with the card is extremely simple but it does the job quite effectively, allowing for quick recording from multiple devices and simple detection for a video signal and output. Input formats can range from 480p to 1080p and frame rates can go as high as 60 frames per second.

Free editing and converter software are included but with a storage memory card placed in the device and you can record a huge amount of footage and then edit it on your PC later on. With the quick connect feature, it is easy to set up recording and then perform all the functions you need for recording, stopping, and pausing on the remote as you use it.

Through two HDMI inputs supported and a very powerful remote control, you record on any device with fantastic image quality and without even having to plug it into any type of computer. While many of these standalone style capture boxes only support the use of minimal storage, this is a device that is capable of getting hooked up to any type of USB external hard drive for a chance to capture nearly unlimited video on your Cloner Box. As a bonus, the MP4 video editing software that is included will make the process of trimming, copying, and converting easier than ever. This has incredible value to the overall product. As an additional bonus, this Cloner Box also features a quick heat dissipation capability which can help to prevent lagging and other common problems that occur with many types of capture boxes when they overheat. A free microphone slot in addition to the HDMI slots makes recording professional voiceovers for any gameplay videos as easy as possible!

Streaming and recording in full 1080p are done quite easily on this device and it's designed to use less processing power than some of the competitors to ensure minimal game lag. RECental is included as part of this device so that you can set up live streaming to many of the top platforms available online. The timeshift function comes with a one-hour buffer ensuring if a great gameplay moment happens, you can shift back and begin recording from that time. Commentary and sharing are made easy with the software that's included with this device. It makes sharing and recording an easy process for any avid video recorder.
