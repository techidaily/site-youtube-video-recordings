Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions.

Hence, when the hacks fail to work and you keep seeing YouTube green screen, try out the following methods to fix this issue.

The computer uses GPU rather than CPU for loading graphic intensive programs during hardware acceleration.

 ![disable hardware acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/disable-hardware-acceleration.jpg)

Nevertheless, some problems might occur when rendering the web pages from the Central Processing Unit to the Graphic Processing Unit. This causes performance problems. You might notice a green or blank screen while you are watching high-quality videos on YouTube.
