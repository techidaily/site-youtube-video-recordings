* Always shoot on landscape
* Ensure there is adequate light and keep the lighting consistent
* Have a shot list, or a guide to show you how you will progress on recording the educational video. This can be compared to a lesson plan in traditional teaching
* Avoid shakes and keep the shots relatively short
