YouTube changed its monetization policy and, once again, there are new monetization rules. Last year, in the wake of the ‘adpocalypse’ ([click here for coverage on that](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube%E2%80%99s-ad-boycott-and-how-it-probably-won%E2%80%99t-affect-you-201.html)), they imposed a new milestone of 10,000-lifetime views which a channel would have to meet before applying for monetization. As of February 20, 2018, YouTube will be introducing 2 more obstacles to monetizing your videos.

## The New Monetization Rules

In order to qualify for YouTube monetization, you must meet these milestones.

 1. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.
 2. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.

 _Trying to get monetization on YouTube can feel like this._

## Why YouTube Changed the Monetization Rules

YouTube’s reasoning for these changes is essentially the same as they gave for the 10,000 views milestone: having higher standards will help them prevent inappropriate or stolen content from being monetized. They also point out that the majority of channels affected will not have been making any significant money anyways (less than $2.50 per month, in most cases).

## How Do the Changes Affect Small YouTube Channels

However, even if the immediate financial impact won’t be that financially significant, it is untrue to say these new rules will not affect YouTubers with smaller channels. Having to plan to achieve and maintain those 4,000 hours of watch time and 1,000 subs could have a major impact on how creators plan their content. Will you feel pressured to abandon content that you and your existing viewers love in favor of making videos that will get you to those milestones faster?

  That will be a question facing a lot of smaller YouTubers, especially those who have already reached 1,000 subscribers and are now in a situation where they have to maintain those 4,000 hours of watch time. You won't be cut off from monetization automatically if you fall from 4,000 hours to 3,500 hours one month (after already having monetized your channel), but YouTube may review your channel and remove monetization if time passes and you still haven't gotten back up to 4,000 hours.

These new rules could also put niche channels at a disadvantage. Niche channels may have devoted followers who keep their watch time up, but getting to 1,000 subscribers could be harder for them purely because their potential audience is already smaller.

## Join The Conversation

There have been b reactions to this news in our forums here on filmora.io, the majority of them negative. Although the perspective that these kinds of measures are necessary as YouTube becomes more and more crowded has also been represented, the majority of people who have weighed in find these changes unreasonable. If you haven't yet, make sure to head over to the forums and [join the conversation](https://www.filmora.io/forum/).

It probably doesn’t help that none of the regulations being put in place to stop smaller channels who might be ‘bad actors’ (YouTube uses the term several times in their announcement) will affect gigantic channels whose creators may already be behaving in wildly inappropriate (and not at all ad friendly) ways.

Cough. Logan Paul. Cough.

## Tips for Increasing YouTube Watch Time

1. Sorting your videos into playlists encourages viewers to spend a lot more time on your channel.
2. Link your videos together using cards and interactive end screens/outros.
3. Basic video editing. Simple things like adding transition effects and cutting out long pauses will help keep viewers watching your videos for longer.

I risk sounding cheesy here, but I hope nobody gives up on their dreams as creators over something like this. Wanting to be paid for doing what you love is only natural, and you can still get there (YouTube monetization isn't even the only way). There may even be better opportunities to generate revenue when you do. In the long run, this could be a good thing for YouTube. Nobody can really know yet.

## How do you pick the best yoga channel on YouTube for you?

With so many yoga videos accessible on YouTube, it can be difficult to know where to begin and which ones would be the greatest fit for you. However, a simple place to start is to look up keywords that you associate with yoga. If you're new to yoga, check for 'beginning classes' or 'introduction to yoga,' for example." SELF speaks with Carlye Cole, a certified yoga teacher who specializes in Hatha, vinyasa, yin yoga, and meditation.

It's also a good idea to brush up on some yoga terminology so you know what each class has to offer. There are many various kinds of yoga, from vinyasa to Hatha to yin, and each practice is exceptionally distinct. That's why, according to Freeman, doing some study on some of the YouTube instructors that came up in your initial search can be beneficial.

It would be best if you began with a shorter session once you've thought of a few alternatives. This will give you a sense of the teacher's style and the type of material they provide. "As you sample the channels and narrow down which ones resonate with you, you can extend the time."

Moreover, it's also beneficial to look for classes where the teachers offer numerous versions for each posture so that you may discover a shape that works for you rather than forcing your body into one certain shape.

![choose a yoga youtube channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-yoga-youtuber-2.jpg)

Here are some suggestions for finding the best yoga YouTube channel:

* They should be well-organized, usually by styles and aims, and include tracking features.
* You can try out different yoga practices without having to look elsewhere since most apps include a selection of instructors and programs.
* Many apps will tailor a routine for you or provide suggestions based on your tastes. You may be able to design your practice routines and sequences with some of these. Select the channel that best meets your requirements.
* Choose a yoga app that offers personalized programs and routines based on a single emphasis area. On the other hand, suggests lessons based on your specific needs and preferred teaching styles.

## How do you pick the best yoga channel on YouTube for you?

With so many yoga videos accessible on YouTube, it can be difficult to know where to begin and which ones would be the greatest fit for you. However, a simple place to start is to look up keywords that you associate with yoga. If you're new to yoga, check for 'beginning classes' or 'introduction to yoga,' for example." SELF speaks with Carlye Cole, a certified yoga teacher who specializes in Hatha, vinyasa, yin yoga, and meditation.

It's also a good idea to brush up on some yoga terminology so you know what each class has to offer. There are many various kinds of yoga, from vinyasa to Hatha to yin, and each practice is exceptionally distinct. That's why, according to Freeman, doing some study on some of the YouTube instructors that came up in your initial search can be beneficial.

It would be best if you began with a shorter session once you've thought of a few alternatives. This will give you a sense of the teacher's style and the type of material they provide. "As you sample the channels and narrow down which ones resonate with you, you can extend the time."

Moreover, it's also beneficial to look for classes where the teachers offer numerous versions for each posture so that you may discover a shape that works for you rather than forcing your body into one certain shape.

![choose a yoga youtube channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-yoga-youtuber-2.jpg)
