## Part 1: What is a VR video on YouTube?

Firstly, it is essential to understand a VR Video on YouTube and how it differs from 360 videos?

VR Videos YouTube – For VR Videos with the YouTube mobile app, you can watch VR videos alongside cardboard. You will have an immersive feeling while watching this as you feel present in the scene actions while having your field of vision covered with a viewing device.

Though both YouTube VR and 360 give an immersive viewing experience with 360-degree coverage, still YouTube 360 videos reflect live actions with modified cameras accessible through 360-degree video-compatible devices. YouTube 360 videos are also viewable on devices such as smartphones, computers, etc., that are compatible. However, here, video progression is not under viewers' control.

On the other hand, VR videos with VR headsets give options to control the viewing experience, such as interacting, running, walk with the video from the viewer's end.

## Pro Tips: How to be a YouTuber and Make Videos Like Sourav Joshi

A fun 11-minute video requires a lot of efforts, including top-tier video editing. If you’re impressed with the work of Sourav, try Filmora to edit your next video.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://www.wondershare.com/?%5Fgl=1%2A3w9lvu%2A%5Fga%2AMTA1Njc4NjEyLjE2NDEzMDcyMTI.%2A%5Fga%5F24WTSJBD5B%2AMTY2MzM0OTI4MS4zMS4xLjE2NjMzNDk0MTIuOC4wLjA.&%5Fga=2.110806337.554158081.1663349281-105678612.1641307212) is an intuitive software that offers a series of features and templates, so you can edit and make your videos impressive, following only a few simple steps which can help you do the right job.

##### Step1 Import your Footage

![import footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-7.jpg)

The first step is to click on “import” to access the folder where you can browse the video clips you need to edit.

##### Step2 Drag your Footage to Timeline

![drag video to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-8.jpg)
