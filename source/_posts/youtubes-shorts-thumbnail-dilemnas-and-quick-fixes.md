## YouTube's Shorts Thumbnail Dilemnas & Quick Fixes

Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set **YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing**? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.

That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.

![youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif)

## Q1\. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?

Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren't that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.

Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:

* Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the "Plus" icon at the bottom center > "Create Short." Upload, edit, and post your video.

* Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel's YouTube Studio.

![opening youtube studio on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG)

* On the left navigation menu, click "Content."

![content section on youtube studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG)

* Click the "pencil" icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.
* Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click "Create Thumbnail."

## Q2\. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?

It's not you who's the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.

_"They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded & somehow generated a new/unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated."_

[YouTuber on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/)

The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9\. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16\. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.

## Q3\. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?

Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.

Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images' resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.

## Q4\. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?

Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.

Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be "snappy." It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.

## Q5\. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?

Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.

Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.

Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.

Luckily, that's going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.

YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.

## Q7\. How Do You Make YouTube Shorts Play Normal?

You can watch Shorts like normal YouTube videos where you can rewind when you want to. Follow these steps.

## Section 1. Necessary Elements of a YouTube Sports Channel

If you want to start a YouTube sports channel, you need to keep in mind that sports videos are fundamentally different from other types of videos. This requires you to have a strong grasp not only on content but video editing as well. Here are some of the top elements that every YouTube sports channel needs.

### 1.Insightful Producer Perspective

First of all, you should try to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the sport you are going to talk about on your channel. If you are just an amateur or a casual fan, you will need to do more preparation as a sports YouTuber.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.Brief and Clear Delivery

The second most important thing is to communicate your perspective in an entertaining, brief, and interactive manner so your viewers remain engaged and keep coming back to your channel. If you fail to communicate properly, your viewers will go somewhere else to watch what they are looking for.

### 3.Advanced Video Editing

Apart from the content, you need to make yourself familiar with using advanced video editing features such as picture-in-picture, screen recording, and audio recording. These allow you to provide a high-quality viewing experience to your YouTube channel audience.

Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:

### 2.Brief and Clear Delivery

The second most important thing is to communicate your perspective in an entertaining, brief, and interactive manner so your viewers remain engaged and keep coming back to your channel. If you fail to communicate properly, your viewers will go somewhere else to watch what they are looking for.

### 3.Advanced Video Editing

Apart from the content, you need to make yourself familiar with using advanced video editing features such as picture-in-picture, screen recording, and audio recording. These allow you to provide a high-quality viewing experience to your YouTube channel audience.

### 4.Branded Intro & Outro

You need to set yourself apart with the impactful branding of your sports YouTube channel. It means that the software you are using on your Mac needs to have smart editing features including the ability to add cool intros and outros that become the trademark of your sports channel.

## Section 2. Must Use Feature for Making a Sports YouTube Channel

There are many features that you may need in your sports content creation. High video quality will bring more views and attract more fans to your YouTube channel. Here are some features you may use in making sports videos.

<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934188/19272" target="_top" id="1934188">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording

One of the top features that you must use in your sports content creation is screen recording. It is a vital feature for all sports YouTubers and it is used extensively for multiple reasons:

* It gives content creators the ability to give demonstrations in a clear and convenient manner that is easily understandable.
* Screen recording also allows them to create how-to and tutorial videos for games and other sports.
* They can also use this feature to record a video clip that may not be easy to include in the final video.

![youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/youtube.jpg)

This feature will give your audience the opportunity to understand your point clearly without having to visualize everything in their heads. Everything you say would be right in front of them in the form of screen recording and they can easily get your perspective.

### 2\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture

Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:

* Picture in Picture allows you to stay visible to your audience while commentating or giving your opinion on a game.
* It also provides you with the ability to divert more focus on the game so the bigger part of the screen is dedicated to sports.
* You can also switch between the smaller and bigger video sections when necessary, for example during a break or interval.
* It gives you the opportunity to make your YouTube channel more personalized with your own take on picture-in-picture.

![pip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/pip.jpg)

Picture in picture is a great feature for sports YouTubers on Mac as it keeps the video entertaining and personalized. Without using a picture-in-picture feature, you will find it difficult to compete with other sports YouTube channels.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording

There are times when you cannot use the native audio of the sports video and need to add your own. It means that you need to record your own audio file and add it to the video before uploading it to your YouTube channel. This feature allows you to:

* Edit the audio of your sports video to make it more customizable according to your target audience.
* Remove the audio that might cause copyright issues and add your own to ensure your content remains original.
* Add your own remarks, commentary, and opinions in the video in full or in parts to make it more engaging and interactive.
* Make videos where you just need background music and don't need the original audio such as montages, tributes, etc.

Clear and crisp audio recording is necessary to ensure that the video you upload on your sports YouTube channel is of high quality. Low-quality audio will damage the whole experience and leave a bad taste in the mouth of your viewers.

## Section 3\. What Video Editing Software Has these Features?

There are many video editing software applications that enable you to use the above-mentioned features. However, if you are just starting out and want to become a producer of your own YouTube sports channel using Mac, here are some of your options:

### 1.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[WonderShare Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- Make sports channel editing easier

If you are just getting ready to do a YouTube sports channel and do not have any experience, Filmora is a good choice. There is no video editing software that provides better value.

This software contains most of the features and functions needed to create sports videos, such as audio and screen recording along with pip capability, and picture-in-picture. You can also use Filmora X to add cool branded intros and outros to customize your sports videos.

### 1\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording

One of the top features that you must use in your sports content creation is screen recording. It is a vital feature for all sports YouTubers and it is used extensively for multiple reasons:

* It gives content creators the ability to give demonstrations in a clear and convenient manner that is easily understandable.
* Screen recording also allows them to create how-to and tutorial videos for games and other sports.
* They can also use this feature to record a video clip that may not be easy to include in the final video.

This feature will give your audience the opportunity to understand your point clearly without having to visualize everything in their heads. Everything you say would be right in front of them in the form of screen recording and they can easily get your perspective.

### 2\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture

Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:

* Picture in Picture allows you to stay visible to your audience while commentating or giving your opinion on a game.
* It also provides you with the ability to divert more focus on the game so the bigger part of the screen is dedicated to sports.
* You can also switch between the smaller and bigger video sections when necessary, for example during a break or interval.
* It gives you the opportunity to make your YouTube channel more personalized with your own take on picture-in-picture.

Picture in picture is a great feature for sports YouTubers on Mac as it keeps the video entertaining and personalized. Without using a picture-in-picture feature, you will find it difficult to compete with other sports YouTube channels.

### 3\. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording

There are times when you cannot use the native audio of the sports video and need to add your own. It means that you need to record your own audio file and add it to the video before uploading it to your YouTube channel. This feature allows you to:

* Edit the audio of your sports video to make it more customizable according to your target audience.
* Remove the audio that might cause copyright issues and add your own to ensure your content remains original.
* Add your own remarks, commentary, and opinions in the video in full or in parts to make it more engaging and interactive.
* Make videos where you just need background music and don't need the original audio such as montages, tributes, etc.

Clear and crisp audio recording is necessary to ensure that the video you upload on your sports YouTube channel is of high quality. Low-quality audio will damage the whole experience and leave a bad taste in the mouth of your viewers.
