### **Where to Get M3U8 Playlist or How to Extract M3U8 Link?**

You may have got an M3U8 video downloader in hand, but don't know how to get an m3u8 streaming playlist link? To download M3U8, extracting .m3u8 link from a video site is what you should prioritize of course. However, the thing is quite complex, as you can't get the .m3u8 link from just copying the URL from the address bar. So, here is the method to extract .m3u8 playlist file link.

1\. Open a video site that use M3U8 format on Chrome. Here we take Youku as an example.  
 2\. Find the video you want to download and play it. Remember to skip the advertisement if there is one.  
 3\. Right-click the video to click on Inspect to see the HTML interface.  
 4\. Click the small phone icon to choose your phone type > refresh the web page > then choose Network > click the funnel icon > click Media > play your video > then there will pop up an .m3u8 link > just copy the link address.

If you want to find the m3u8 link in Firefox, just right-click the video > Inspect and there would be an m3u8 link.

Worth mentioning, not all video sites adopt the .m3u8 as the video format. We have tested that most mainstream video streaming sites including Dailymotion and Vimeo don't offer .m3u8 video links. But luckily, you can directly copy the video URL from such sites to 5KPlayer and [download online videos music](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) with peace of mind.
