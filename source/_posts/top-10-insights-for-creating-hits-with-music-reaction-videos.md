Every day, 2.51 billion active users watch over one billion hours of content. Creators can showcase their work in high definition, up to 8K, on the platform, which is a major advantage. Mobile devices and smartphones also allow offline viewing of videos.

#### Dailymotion Content and Audience

### Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential

YouTube's YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising. You'll get 55% of the revenue generated by the ads shown during, before, and after your videos. It is also possible to charge channel memberships. For every 1,000 views, the average YouTuber makes about $18.
