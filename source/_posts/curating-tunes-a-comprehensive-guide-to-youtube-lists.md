## Extra Tip: Facebook Video Tips for more Views and Shares

You have to play your cards well when it comes to posting and sharing your videos on Facebook. These tips are all you need.

#### \- Catch viewer’s attention within the shortest time possible

Here, your main aim is to convince your viewers. So, don’t let them spend so much time before you catch their attention. You can bring up a point about some latest news or adventures that let your viewers connect immediately.

#### \- Add captions to the video

It is not necessarily possible that viewers will watch your videos with the sound on. Some like it when it’s silent and might disable the sound auto-play. Add some captions so that viewers will understand your video, even on silent mode.

#### \- Emphasize on one key-point
