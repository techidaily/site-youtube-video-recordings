Logos are a very important part of branding yourself, especially if you’re an online business or personality, and that's why we've made this list of YouTube logo makers. When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.

1. [PIXLR EDITOR](#pixlr)
2. [GETPAINT](#getpaint)
3. [CANVA](#canva)
4. [DESIGNEVO](#designevo)
5. [LOGOMAKR](#logomakr)
6. [FOTOR](#fotor)
7. [SNAPPA](#snappa)
8. [LOGASTER](#logaster)
9. [COOLTEXT](#cooltext)

## 1\. [PIXLR EDITOR](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.

## 2\. [GETPAINT](https://www.getpaint.net/)

GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.

## 3\. [CANVA](https://www.canva.com/)

Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.

## 4\. [DESIGNEVO](https://www.designevo.com/)

Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.

## 5\. [LOGOMAKR](https://logomakr.com/)

Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.

## 6\. [FOTOR](https://www.fotor.com/)

Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. [SNAPPA](https://snappa.com/)

Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.

## 8\. [LOGASTER](https://www.logaster.com/)

For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 9\. [COOLTEXT](https://cooltext.com/)

Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.

## Why do we need to download and convert YouTube Shorts video?

Most YouTube Shorts are not easily accessible on mobile devices. Occasionally, users experience [YouTube Shorts not showing issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which prompts them to look for solutions for resolving the problem. You might be wondering whether converting your files is one such solution. Ideally yes! Find below, possible reasons for downloading and converting YouTube Shorts to MP4.

#### 1) Content optimization for other devices

Mobile technology keeps changing and various devices’ versions are continually on the rise. Some devices aren’t compatible with various [video formats and codecs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Converting the videos to MP4 opens avenues for access on any device and platform like emails. This is because MP4 files are supported by almost all modern devices and you can optimize videos for operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows, etc.

#### 2) Compression

YouTube Shorts are designed to run for about 15 seconds. This is an indication that they are not fully compressed in terms of codec. Converting the files to MP4 format ensures that the file size is reduced, enabling playing on any platform without buffering. Luckily, there is no quality loss but it’s just the size is made smaller to fit any device.

#### 3) To support animated GIFs

Animated GIFs add value to your videos. However, social media does not support GIFs among other formats. To keep the fun going, you will need to convert your video to accommodate formats like GIFs, among others.

#### 4) Portability

Another reason to get YouTube shorts to MP4 is for portability issues. Since MP4 are highly accessible on numerous devices and platforms, you can easily import your files via USB flash drive and other external hard disks to other devices. With this, there is also no hindrance in sharing your files online and on other platforms.

#### 5) Lossless quality

MP4 file format supports a high degree of lossless output quality as compared to other file formats. MP4 is highly preferred so that the recipient achieves the original output quality of the converted file. With MP4, you can also retain other parameters like title, sample rate, and channel among others.

## How can we convert YouTube shorts to mp4?

Both free, paid, and online converter apps can serve the purpose. Let’s check how to convert your files for free with the Freemake app, via an online app, and using the reliable tool, Filmora.

#### 1\. Convert YouTube Shorts video to MP4 with Freemake

This is an easy-to-use converter that you use freely to trim your videos as well as convert them to various formats.

You, however, can evade this if you upgrade to the Premium version.
