#### **Why Is youtubekids.com Website not Working Now?**

On August 29, 2019, Google had announced that YouTube Kids on the web was already live at www.youtubekids.com. However, the imminent launch was quietly closed and the opening time is still unconfirmed. It didn't get popular because it had violated U.S. children's privacy laws, COPPA by collecting data under the age of 13 for ads purposes.
