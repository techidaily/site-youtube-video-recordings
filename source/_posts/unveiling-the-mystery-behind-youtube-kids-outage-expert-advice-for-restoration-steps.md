Based on YouTube down errors, this article will try to explain the possible reasons like error 500 and 503 and offer solutions to solve youtubekids website down error.

#### **Why Is youtubekids.com Website not Working Now?**

On August 29, 2019, Google had announced that YouTube Kids on the web was already live at www.youtubekids.com. However, the imminent launch was quietly closed and the opening time is still unconfirmed. It didn't get popular because it had violated U.S. children's privacy laws, COPPA by collecting data under the age of 13 for ads purposes.

YouTube is trying hard to settle the problem, and we assure youtubekids.com website will come back soon. Besides the privacy problem causing youtubekids.com down problem, there may be some other errors you need to fix.
