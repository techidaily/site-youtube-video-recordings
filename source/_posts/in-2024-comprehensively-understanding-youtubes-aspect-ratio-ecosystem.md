* [Part 3: Adding Timestamps to YouTube Videos on Mobile](#part3)
* [part 4: Benefits of Adding Timestamps to YouTube Videos](#part4)
* [Part 5: Tips for Adding Timestamps to YouTube Videos](#part5)

## Part 1: What is a YouTube Timestamp?

A YouTube Timestamp is one of the ‘key moments’ features of Google. It is the best method to link your user to a specific moment of your video. It is very often noticed that people keep skipping the content, as they cannot find what they have been looking for.

![ youtube timestamps in google serp ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-timestamp-google-serp.jpg)

In such cases, you can prefer adding the **YouTube video Timestamps** to improve the retention of the viewers for a longer time. What is more interesting about it is that you can also provide a reference in minutes and seconds of the video.

## Part 2: How to Add Timestamps to YouTube Video on Desktop?

A very few YouTube videos at present have Timestamps in them. It usually is due to the reason that majority of people are not aware of it. Or, in some other cases, they are still wondering, ‘**how to add Timestamps to YouTube video**.’

In detail, let us tell you how you can add these timestamps to your videos on Desktop.

1. Log in to your YouTube and move to the ‘Description’ section on the video.
2. For linking a specific part to timestamp, begin by typing the time in the format **minutes:seconds**.

![ add chapter timecode to youtube ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-chapter-youtube-description.jpg)

1. Then add your keyword to the specific video segment and click on ‘Save.’
2. Reload the published video and then check the ‘Description’ section once again and update it accordingly.

![ youtube timestamp description ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-chapter-description-appearance.jpg)

That is it, and you are done with adding Timestamps to a YouTube video!

Note: you need to add 0:00 at the beginning of the timestamps so that they can show up. And you may need to add 3 or more timestamps, and each should last 10 seconds or longer.

## Part 3: How to Add Timestamps to YouTube Videos on Mobile?

So, when it is about adding the timestamps on mobile, things are a bit different for sure! However, we have done a thorough research and managed to get a step-by-step tutorial to add these timestamps to YouTube videos on the mobile app.

1. Log in to the YouTube Studio app on your mobile.
2. Click on the ‘Menu’ icon, which is present in the upper left corner of the screen.
3. Select the video and press on the video where you want to add timestamps.
4. Click on the pencil icon, which is present on the topmost right corner of the screen and then add timestamps in the description!

Format - The time is indicated by t=, which is followed by the number of seconds you want the video to start playing from. t= 2m46s is an example of a Timestamp. If the URL of the video contains a question mark (?) at the end, then, in that case, use the ampersand (&) before the time stamp. Example - &t=2m46ss!

**Note -** Make sure the initial timestamp is “0:00 Start” to activate the YouTube Chapters function. To use YouTube Chapters, you need to add at least three chapters to a video, with each chapter lasting at least ten seconds.

## Part 4: Why Should You Add Timestamps to YouTube Videos?

A few reasons why YouTube Timestamps are a must for you to try are mentioned below. Make sure that you go through them!

* **Increased SEO Opportunities**

The use of **YouTube Timestamps** can be regarded as a very useful SEO video hack. The ranking of YouTube videos is completely based on the watch time and retention of the audience. Hence, when a user clicks on the Timestamp, YouTube will log this as two views. The initial click counts as the first view. Next will be the second view, which is the Timestamped moment of the video. This 2-on-1 benefit helps in increasing the video ranking.

Now, it is time for all the YouTube creators to switch to this feature for higher rankings. This will take off in 2021, particularly amongst the mobile phone users, since now even Google supports Timestamp hyperlinks. Timestamps will become increasingly important for YouTubers in the coming year.

* **User Experience Enhanced**

Jumbling for a specific part of a video can be annoying for the user, and they might end up closing it. Anyone would not certainly want to watch the entire 15 minutes of video for nugget-sized information. Hence, using Timestamps is indeed a benefit for you. With this feature, you can now overcome this issue and get a huge victory of an increase in the count of viewers.

* **Perk for the Mobile Users**

Google has started rewarding the Timestamps for the YouTube videos. It appears to be paying attention to the Timestamps on the videos and then linking to each chapter or header in the YouTube description.

## Part 5: Should I Add Timestamps to All YouTube Videos?

Almost every video put up on the internet is designed so as to get optimized as per the SEO trends. Google has mentioned it clearly that “[how-to videos which have multiple steps, should have Timestamps](https://www.blog.google/products/search/key-moments-video-search/).” However, the truth is that every video which is long and has multiple pointers or steps in it should have the **YouTube Timestamps** in it.

From product reviews to the help tutorials, can reap benefits from this feature of YouTube. This is something you should think about before you start adding chapters to your video.

**Conclusion**

One of the most effective methods to boost visibility about your brand or product is to create entertaining content online. Using Timestamps in your videos, you may enhance the ranking of your video, enhance the viewer experience, and develop long-term partnerships with a larger audience. You can certainly try experimenting with YouTube at any point in your video and see what happens.
