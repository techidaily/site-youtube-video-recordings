**Stock Videos:**

Go to the official site of [Filmora video stocks](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/). There are a large number of video templates, stock videos, images, and audio files.

You can also access the stock videos from Pixels, Giphy, Pixabay, and Unsplash without leaving the Filmora Software. Go to the Stock Media section in the top menu to access these.

Now you can easily find content to make your videos attractive.

**Elements:**

Filmora has an extensive stock of Elements; with the proper use of Elements in YouTube videos, you can make them engaging and interactive. You already know the importance of interactive videos.

Find multiple elements from the Element section beside the effects and transition section in Filmora.

**Transition:**

Transition smoothens the video, especially when various clips are combined. Use transitions from the Filmora Transition section and set the stage for the next scene, convey the mood and smoothen your YouTube video.

The presence of this library reduces the labor of finding images on the internet, makes them accessible to the user, and makes the video interesting.

##### Step7 Export and save the video

The video is saved by simply clicking ‘ Export.’ You can always share the video online or offline, either publish directly on social media or save it on your computer for later upload.
