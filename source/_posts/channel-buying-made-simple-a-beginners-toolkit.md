Show that you care. And note that every comment or review matters a lot to your brand. So, strive to respond to every comment that a viewer leaves on your page.
7. **Give thought to the channel description.**  
Here is where some YouTube channels miss it all. The description should be engaging and inviting. That’s the only way to lure viewers to hit that subscribe button. Let the description tell viewers what the channel is about and give other important information.
8. **Video quality**  
Your video is your voice when it comes to promoting your channel. Ensure you give people quality videos with a piece of detailed advice that works for them. Also, remember to upload quality videos regularly to boost the growth of your channel. A good video should have high resolution, among other good qualities.

#### Filmora - a useful tool to help make creative videos

Being creative and composing powerful videos is a plus if you want your YouTube channel to grow. That’s the tactic that highly ranked subscribers employ during video creation. We use Filmora, a video editing program with advanced features, to transform your video into a work of art. Use it to edit and export your videos at a high resolution of up to 4K. It also lets you layer several video clips with its Picture in Picture track feature.

#### Other important characteristics

The video should be edited with as little effect as possible. You can edit your video by splitting, merging, rotating, etc., from its interface. Filmora has simple steps for these.

**Noise removal**  
Polish your video by removing unwanted background noise to help improve the overall outcome.

**GIF support**  
You can add GIF images and then import or export your video to YouTube and other platforms

**Detach audio**  
Filmora lets you do audio separation from your video and edit it separately. You can change the background music to your favorite.

**Preview**  
Preview your video frame by frame and make any precise adjustments necessary before you release it to the public.

**Advanced formatting**  
Stylish effects like overlays and transitions can give you a compelling piece of video that will woe subscribers to your channel.

## Conclusion

**●** YouTube is a trustworthy platform that provides a diverse range of activities such as gaming, tutorials, the film industry, and cooking, among many others. Content creators use it to promote their brands and build a database of subscribers. It takes a considerable amount of effort to match **the fastest-growing YouTube channels**. A major contributing factor to the highly increasing number of subscribers is a clear video that is easily understood. The best video editor, Filmora, can help you achieve a milestone as far as composing a selling video is concerned.
