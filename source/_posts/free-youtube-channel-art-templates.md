[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and launch the Filmora software on Mac or Windows PC.

Step2 Tap on New Project > Click here to import media.

![click here to import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-7.jpg)

Step3 After choosing the video file or files from your device, drag them to the editor timeline below.

![drag video to editor timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-8.jpg)

Step4 From the toolbar just above the timeline, click on the standard functions you want to use for editing the video. For example, click on the file and press the Crop icon.

![press the crop icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-9.jpg)

Step5 At the top-most toolbar, you can see many tabs for editing, like Effects, Audio, Titles, etc. Click on them to get the drop-down menu of available effects, audio clips, and more. Add the ones you choose by dragging them to the video on the timeline.

![click on audio tab and drag it to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/ryan-kajis-net-worth-11-year-old-boy-gets-highest-paid-from-youtube-2022-10.jpg)

Continue with further editing work using other tools available, like speed adjustment, background removal (chroma key), and more.

Step6 After completing the edits, click the Export button. Choose to download it offline by selecting Local and choosing your preferred format. Make further changes in the settings.

Or, you can directly post the video to your linked YouTube account.

Step7 Tap the Export button.

## Final Words

Overall, Ryan Kaji saw great success with his stunning and engaging videos on his YouTube channel over the years. Also, he focused on other ventures, with the support of the team behind his channel, for income and editing work.

But, while starting, your funding will be less. It would help if you handled the video editing work on your own first, with reliable software like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Also, use other analytics tools and strategies to improve your channel further.
