#### 3. Taha Chimar

Those who do not have PhotoShop can use Taha Chimar‚Äôs end screen designs that come in png file format.

To download, you will have to follow a URL link in the description box of the YouTube videos. Be careful, though, as a lot of the links lead to free hosting websites with pop-ups that can harm your computer if you are easily fooled by them.
