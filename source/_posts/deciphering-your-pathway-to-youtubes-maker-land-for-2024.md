5\. Free software programs can also get the malware to your system and therefore these are not recommended at all.

6\. WAV is a format that is of high quality as the converters have loads of options so it is advised to use these carefully.

7\. Make sure that the converters that are used are the ones that are highly rated and have a graphical user interface.

8\. The YouTube to WAV downloader should be there on with the converter as it will make the process easy and you don't need tons of software programs for a single purpose.

9\. Always go for the program that supports the containers instead of just the format. If a program supports the containers then it is easy to convert a number of formats.

10\. The conversion should be done with converters that do not cause any type of loss to enhance the quality as well.
