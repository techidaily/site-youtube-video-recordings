**https://youtu.be/wNDGgL73ihY**  
Of all the ultimate philosophical questions – " Where do we come from?" is a frequently asked one that has something to do with The Big Bang, also called the Beginning of Everything. Fortunately that we've come to this piece of science video for kids – with obscure process represented in the explanatory animation associated with comprehensive transcripts, this very science video for kids and students illustrated the beginning of everything into 7 steps: Expansion, quarks, gluons, hadrons, neutrons, hydrogen atoms, which later generated plasma under radiation. Aside from all the known facts about the Big Bang, this special science video for children also points out its own assumption as of the time before everything – before the Big Bang could have been a Big Bounce, with the previous universe somehow stopped where we picked up again, this inspiring video could leave some space for your children to explore.

It may take you some time persuading your child without much knowledge or interest in astronomy to watch this Black Hole space science video for kids: Released in 2015 on the official Discovery YouTube Channel, this video consist of the iffy concept of wormhole, white hole, and the black hole. In a chronic manner this 320p-only educational video for kids is 44-minutes long, with the nitty gritty details of black holes been covered: A region in space with extreme strong gravity, so strong that there's no way for any object that gets too near to break from its gravitational pull.

**4\. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity Science Video for Kids** 
 **https://youtu.be/6XSAVqm0XBI**  
It's quite necessary to tell the Special Theory of Relativity from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity with a special science video for kids like this, especially before he somehow managed to read further material related to it elsewhere. If you could also spend some time for the Special Relativity, you may well download the NO.8 science video for kids introduced below with the free 5KPlayer so as to know them better. Unlike in the Special Theory of Relativity is illustrated with such concepts as time dilation, length contract, and the possibility of time travel, this science video for students introduces Einstein's General Theory of Relativity to help us understand more of the gravitational pull and the effect of gravity: The the spacetime is warped because of mass, and an object moves towards the most massive object in its neighborhood. Another concept introduced in this kids science video is that not only space, but also time is warped – in weaker gravitational field, time clocks a slight little faster – warped. The very first video introduced in this passage – The Big Bang is also part of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. At the end of this science video, however, it points out one fact observed by scientists now that isn't in line with the classical theory – that the universe is expanding faster than projected – for what reason could this happen at all? You may well download this interesting science video for kids to check out!

**5\. Einstein's Theory of Relativity Science Video for Kids** 
**https://youtu.be/ttZCKAMpcAo**

 Looking for a basic introduction for Einstein's Theory for Relativity and this very science video for kids is a must-watch: By simplifying the basic science concepts including the Classical Relativity, how time dilation and length contraction in the Special Theory of Relativity helps to maintain a constant Speed of Light in the form of animation science video for kids, this piece makes some abstract concepts much easier to understand. Also in this science video is the General Theory of Relativity – pointing to how objects warped spacetime around itself, thus leading to gravitational attraction. Speed of speech in this science video for children is slow, containing only the very basic terminologies, thus making it a must-watch as a starting point for further learning. 

**6\. Gravitational Wave Science Video for Kids** 
**https://youtu.be/4GbWfNHtHRg**

Back in February 11, 2016 when the gravitational detection by LIGO laboratory excited the world, the frenzy of what is gravitational waves intrigued the world to learn more about what it is. If you child happens to be one of the many GW fans, this piece of science video for kids illustrating what is the wave, under what occasion does it come into being, as well as how us humans have managed to detect it by using measuring the interference of the lasers between different point of an equipment in the LOGO laboratory. By creating simulated images of this ripple in the fabric of space and time, the recommended science video is indeed a good niche to introduce your kid to gravitational wave. 

**7\. Matter vs Antimatter Science Video for Kids** 
**https://youtu.be/3ZWqQciAQlU**
