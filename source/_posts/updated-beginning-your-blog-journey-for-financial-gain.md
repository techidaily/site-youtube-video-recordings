![background of vlogs on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg)

What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017\. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.

**Why vlogs are loved by people**

Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.

But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

So you've started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren't you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let's look at some common reasons why vloggers aren't making any income and figure out how to get around them.

### Who is my target audience?

![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

### What problems am I solving?

![problem solving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg)

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

### Content quality

With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it's clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube's algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you're looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you'll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.

And to do that, you must try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editing software. Let’s have an overview of WonderShare Filmora 11 and how we can create quality content using it.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let's break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.

### YouTube Ads

![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship

![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

### Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg)

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

![support on patreon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg)

By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

### Sell your service or products

![sell products or services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg)

## Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you'll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.

## The Bottom Line

So, in summary, if you want to become a vlogger, you will need to figure out how to find your target audience, connect with them, and keep them interested in you. And you can do all of this through social media, advertising, and email marketing. It might be tough at first, but once you get started, you'll be able to start generating revenue pretty quickly.

## Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you'll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.

## The Bottom Line

So, in summary, if you want to become a vlogger, you will need to figure out how to find your target audience, connect with them, and keep them interested in you. And you can do all of this through social media, advertising, and email marketing. It might be tough at first, but once you get started, you'll be able to start generating revenue pretty quickly.

Earlier, you learned how to have a **[bounce text effect in Adobe After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. However, because AE is a complex application and has a steep learning curve, this section explains the two alternative ways to get the same effect on your existing video footage.

## Method 1: How to Create Bouncing Text in Filmora Video Editor?

When talking about [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the application is populated with several presets for texts and titles, animations, effects, filters, and much more.

These pre-built templates not only make your task easier, they also save your decent amount of time that you would spend while working with After Effects or any other similar app that requires you to build things from scratch.

You can follow the instructions given below to **add animated bounce text** to any of your video footages with Filmora:

#### Step 1: Add a Footage to Timeline

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC. By default, the [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of the project is set to 16:9\. Click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left section, and select and import footage you want to add bounce text to.

#### Step 2: Insert Text and Add Bounce Effect

Click **Titles** from the standard toolbar at the top, and click and drag your preferred title template from the Library to the timeline. In case you don’t want any specific animation or style on the title, you can use the default title.

In the timeline, double-click the title you just added, use the upper-left section to edit the text, go to the **Animation** tab from the left pane, scroll down the list, and double-click the **Up Down 1** or **Up Down 2** preset to apply the bounce effect to the credits. Click **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the main window.

![Create Bouncing Text video Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-up-down-animation-to-bounce.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Shake Filters**

Go to **Effects** from the standard toolbar, expand the **Filters** category from the left pane, and click **Shake**. From the Library window, click and drag your preferred shake filter to the timeline. Here, I will choose Mild.

![Shake filters in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shake-filter.jpg)

You can customize the default effect by double-clicking the shake filter in the timeline, using the sliders in the upper-left area of the interface to make necessary adjustments, and then clicking **OK** to save the changes and to get back to the previous interface.

![Mild Shake filters adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mild-shake-filter-adjust.jpg)

**Step 4: Export the Final Output**

Click **EXPORT** from the top of the interface, go to the **Local** tab in the **Export** box, choose your preferred output format from the list in the left, make required customizations from the right pane, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the video.

![Filmora9 Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-filmora9-video.jpg)

Now, you can add the bouncing text video and the background video to the timeline, and then place the bouncing text video above the background video track.

Double click the text track, go to the **Chroma Key** effect, select the **Color Picker** tool, and click anywhere in the Preview window to get things right. Finally, export the entire project to your preferred output format as explained in **Step 4**.

As explained before, Wondeshare Filmora makes the entire process of creating and adding **bounce text** effect pretty simple. With all the pre-build templates, and the versatility of the options that can be used to customize those presets, you can come up with the effects that are usually obtained when you start generating them from the scratch.

## Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online

If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead. The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.

Some most trusted websites to generate **bounce text** are listed below:

#### 1\. ENGFTO

Website: <https://engfto.com/index/create%5Fanimated%5Fbouncing%5Ftext/0-26>

Modify the values in the fields under the **SIZE AREA** and **TEXT** sections to customize the text area, the text itself, its size, and font. Next, adjust the values in the fields under the **EFFECT PARAMETERS** section to get the required bounce effect. Also, use the fields under the **BACKGROUND** section to either change the background color, or pick a background image from your PC.

**Step 3: Obtain the Animated Text**

Click the **SAVE GIF ANIMATION** button from the lower section of the page to download the animated text to your PC.

Use the options available on the webpage to type your text, and change its font, color, background, transparency level etc. Select **Bounce** (or any of its variants) from the **Animation** drop-down list, and adjust the speed using the **Speed** slider.

**Step 3: Obtain the Text**

Click your preferred option from next to the **Download As** section to download the animated text to your PC.

**Note:** Regardless of the web solution you choose to generate and obtain animated **bounce text**, you will still need a post-production tool to add the downloaded text to your footage.

Generating **bounce text** effect is much simpler when you use Wondershare Filmora or any of the online solutions as explained in Method 2\. While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC.

## Method 2: Generate Animated Bouncing Texts Online

If you don’t want any heavy and resource-intensive app on your PC merely for some special text effects, you can try any of the online solutions instead. The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.

Some most trusted websites to generate **bounce text** are listed below:

#### 1\. ENGFTO

Launch your favorite web browser, and go to the link given above to get to the Engfto’s animated bouncing text page.

**Step 2: Customize Text and Preferences**

Modify the values in the fields under the **SIZE AREA** and **TEXT** sections to customize the text area, the text itself, its size, and font. Next, adjust the values in the fields under the **EFFECT PARAMETERS** section to get the required bounce effect. Also, use the fields under the **BACKGROUND** section to either change the background color, or pick a background image from your PC.

**Step 3: Obtain the Animated Text**

Click the **SAVE GIF ANIMATION** button from the lower section of the page to download the animated text to your PC.

#### 2\. Loading.io

The instructions given below explain how to use Loading.io to get animated **bounce text** effect for your footages:

Use the options available on the webpage to type your text, and change its font, color, background, transparency level etc. Select **Bounce** (or any of its variants) from the **Animation** drop-down list, and adjust the speed using the **Speed** slider.

**Step 3: Obtain the Text**

Click your preferred option from next to the **Download As** section to download the animated text to your PC.

**Note:** Regardless of the web solution you choose to generate and obtain animated **bounce text**, you will still need a post-production tool to add the downloaded text to your footage.

**Conclusion**

Generating **bounce text** effect is much simpler when you use Wondershare Filmora or any of the online solutions as explained in Method 2\. While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC. In addition, many times the web apps offer their services for free, and therefore they are preferred by the novice users who are not much into post-production processes.
