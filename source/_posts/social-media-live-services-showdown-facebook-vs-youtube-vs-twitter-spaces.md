## Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?

**1. Audience:**

 We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.

**2. User Interface:**

 Here is one more interesting factor to discuss about all these amazing Live streaming platforms. This feature makes a system or software standout among other competitors. If we compare user interface of Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube Live then you will find them all almost similar. But most of the beginners rate Facebook as most simple and user friendly tool for live broadcasts. Second rating is received by Periscope whereas YouTube Live stands on third level. User interface of Periscope and Facebook live possesses so many similar features such as ability to subscribe, comment or updating likes etc.

**3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:**

 Let us discuss about saving broadcasts as well as get some idea about their ability to arrange embedding replays. The video archiving ability of YouTube and Facebook is having almost similar kind of features. Users are able to update their live streams and they can also be saved for longer run, even permanently as per need. If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.

**4. Interaction:**

**Communicate with Broadcasters:**

 If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.

**Interaction with Viewers:**

 Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices.

In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations. Periscope broadcasts can also be enjoyed on Twitter platform directly but here you cannot update hearts directly. Also, comments remains dedicated to Twitter and Periscope environment. YouTube Live allows users to share their viewing experiences with comments and it helps broadcasters to get feedbacks for improvement. Content from YouTube Live can also be shared on other platforms.

 Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations. Periscope broadcasts can also be enjoyed on Twitter platform directly but here you cannot update hearts directly. Also, comments remains dedicated to Twitter and Periscope environment. YouTube Live allows users to share their viewing experiences with comments and it helps broadcasters to get feedbacks for improvement. Content from YouTube Live can also be shared on other platforms.

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:

 YouTube offers two main areas for image display of your channel. One is an icon image while other is what YouTube calls "Channel Art". This is the same as Facebook's cover photo. People often call it "YouTube banner". It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.

![youtube video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg)

 For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.

 Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it's highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.

 Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.

 The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.

 File size refers to the space that a file occupies in a storage medium, like hard drive or USB. The measure of file sizes can be expressed in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and so on.

## What's the best YouTube video size for you?

 It is recommended by professionals to use the YouTube video dimensions 1080p, or 1920 x 1080.

 These ones are the ideal because it will not only facilitate the video with a professional and elite look but also consumes relatively much less data. Moreover, if you use a phone for recording your videos then using the quality higher than the ones mentioned above will cost you with ample memory.

 If you are a newbie to the world of YouTube and want to up the device's storage game then 720p would still do wonders.

## What is the video aspect ratio?

 This term refers to the proportion of your video. In other words, the video aspect ratio can be defined as the width or breadth (of an image or screen) with respect to its height. Such a ratio can be expressed or represented in the form of "width x height.

 That means an aspect ratio of 4x3 refers to an image that is 4 unit wide and 3 units high. Similarly, it can also be expressed with a colon in between the units such as 4:3 or 16:9.

 The aspect ratio of a video merely refers to the relationship among the width and height respectively and not the actual physical size of the image.

 The most common aspect ratios used in the video are depicted below for sound understanding:

![dimensions of a youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-aspect-ratios.jpg)

 Image from learn.g2

 The aspect ratio is the proportion of your video. This image displays the three most common aspect ratios.

 Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of height and width although dimensions refer to two separate measurements of height and width rather than a ratio with "pixel" as its unit.

## Standard aspect ratios

 Below are the most common aspect ratios used for the video. There may be certain amendments to the ones mentioned below but the following formats are used mostly by the film and video makers.

 Let's review the quick breakdown of the available aspect ratio options that you can opt accordingly:

| Aspect ratio | Application                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1:1 or 1x1   | This aspect ratio will mostly be seen in the Instagram video. This 1:1 ratio gives a video a perfect square shape.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4:3 or 4x3   | This aspect ratio was mostly seen few ages ago in almost the amidst 20th century on the TV. This was used to be a standard television format back then. So if you are a 90's kid or an adult then you must be familiar with this format while watching your favorite old schooled sitcoms! |
| 16:9 or 16x9 | The format was enhanced to 16:9 aspect ratio for more HD quality and better viewing experience. This format is widely being used in televisions, theatres, DVD or high definition professional videos.                                                                                     |
| 21:9 or 21x9 | For more than merely an HD video quality and astonishing user experience, the formats have been upgraded to 21:9 aspect ratio. This is dominantly being used in the cinema for movie theatre releases.                                                                                     |

## The right aspect ratio for YouTube videos

 YouTube recommends using an aspect ratio of **16:9**  according to the video player that YouTube uses. You are also given an option to upload your videos vertically but this will amend the aspect ratio respectively.

 When you upload a video with an aspect ratio other than the one mention formerly then YouTube will automatically place the black bars on the sides. This is done to display the best quality video with the right resolution otherwise it will be displayed as distorted or cropped.

 A vertical ratio with may be 4:3 video aspect ratio will be displayed like the image given below:

### 3\. Perfect size for your YouTube banner

 YouTube offers two main areas for image display of your channel. One is an icon image while other is what YouTube calls "Channel Art". This is the same as Facebook's cover photo. People often call it "YouTube banner". It is a header image displayed at the top of your channel.

![youtube video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-banner-size.jpg)

 For each kind of display (mobile, desktop, and TV), channel art (or banner) dimension changes accordingly.

 Either your cover photo or your YouTube banner is displayed at the top of the channel so it's highly significant to consider what you are depicting about your channel through these images.

 Hence, this being said or realized, selecting the appropriate banner resolution should be among your topmost priorities.

 The recommended banner dimensions of a YouTube video as suggested by YouTube are 2560 x 1440 pixels. But the dimensions may slightly vary with the variation in the devices being used by the users.
