The truth is that YouTube gives room for you still to make a **business account** with a business name thus, eliminating the need to use a business name in creating your Google account.

**2\. Creating a business name**

Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.

Selecting the custom name gives you the autonomy to use the brand or business name of your choice, after which you tap on the create option.

**3\. Customize your business page**

At this point, you can design the layout by utilizing the appealing icon and banner of your choice, just as provided by the likes of Facebook or Twitter. The customized templates in Canva are there for you to design your page to your state.

I know you would be wondering how to go about this; YouTube can directly upload your artwork with a preview option available. You can crop your artwork to fit your page, making it look more professional.

To be emphatic, creating a business account is still simple but with professionalism. Remember you are selling yourself and your brand, and it is expedient to give your best on your page. Do well to describe your page as excellent as you can, let your activity in terms of photo and video uploads be of the best. This way, subscribers will not hesitate to hit the like and subscribe button. Good luck as you kick-start your business page.

**Attribution (by)**: you should credit the creator of the sound. Usually, this means adding a 'Sound effect by Username on Freesound' line in the description of your video. So long as you credit the artists you can do anything with these sounds, even monetize the videos you use them in.

**Attribution-Noncommercial (by –nc)**: you must credit the creators of these sound effects and you cannot make money off of them. This means that you cannot monetize a video in which you used these sound effects.

Freesound is a social site where you can talk to the creators of the sounds you want to download. If you are planning to monetize a video that uses an Attribution-Noncommercial sound effect you can always ask the artist for permission.

Sound effects can add a lot of excitement to your videos. Sometimes they are even used for comedic effect. For example, you might use a fake slap sound in a slapstick comedy sketch. Other times sound effects can be more subtle. You might want to add city noises to the background of your video to help set your scene, or a droning sound to build suspense. A lot of the most popular [free sound effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are related to the genres of science fiction or action.

## Part 1: Three Types of Sound Effects

### 1\. Without License

When you want to download sound effects for YouTube, the licensed ones cannot be used, but there are a few that do not hold a license and can be easily downloaded from the website. The quality might be poor to some extent, but you may use the sound effects without a license in any product or video.

### 2\. Creative Commons License

The sound effects under the [CC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative%5FCommons%5Flicense) need to be checked for their type. There are some vlog sound effects that can be used for personal projects free but not for commercial ones. There are a few sound effects that might just require attribution or credit to the creator and cannot be modified in any way.

### 3\. Royalty-free license

You may download sound effects for YouTube by purchasing the licensed sound effects that a professional offers. When you purchase it, you will get high-quality sound, and you may use it on one or more projects, irrespective of personal or commercial types.

## Part 2: Royalty-Free Sound Effects for Your YouTube Videos

This article will introduce you to the six best sites to find royalty-free sound effects and explain their terms of use.

### 1.[YouTube Audio Library – Free!](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/)

![sound effects on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sound-effects-YouTube.JPG)

Besides royalty-free music, the YouTube Audio Library also has sound effects that you can download for free. The sound effects in YouTube's library are organized into categories. You can select a category, i.e 'sci-fi', from the drop-down menu next to the search bar and browse through just the types of sounds you are interested in. You can also favorite sounds you like so you can find them again easily.

The sound effects you download from YouTube's library can be used as many times as you like and in as many different projects. Monetizing your videos will not impact your ability to use these sound effects either. Some other sources of sound effects have different rules about monetizing or using sound effects in multiple projects.

### 2.[Freesound – Free!](https://freesound.org/)

![freesound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sound-effects-Freesound-logo.JPG)

Freesound.org is a huge database of royalty-free sound effects and other audio files. All downloads are free, but there are conditions for using some of the sounds on Freesound. There are three different Creative Commons licenses uses on Freesound and which one applies to the sound effect you want depends on the user who posted it.

The three licenses used on Freesound are **Zero**, **Attribution**, and **Attribution-Noncommercial.**

**Zero (cc0)**: you can do anything you want with these sound effects except claim that you created them. You can make money off of them and you do not have to credit the original creator.

**Attribution (by)**: you should credit the creator of the sound. Usually, this means adding a 'Sound effect by Username on Freesound' line in the description of your video. So long as you credit the artists you can do anything with these sounds, even monetize the videos you use them in.

**Attribution-Noncommercial (by –nc)**: you must credit the creators of these sound effects and you cannot make money off of them. This means that you cannot monetize a video in which you used these sound effects.

Freesound is a social site where you can talk to the creators of the sounds you want to download. If you are planning to monetize a video that uses an Attribution-Noncommercial sound effect you can always ask the artist for permission.

I've also found a YouTube video that explains the Creative Commons in detail. You can watch it below.

### 3.[AudioJungle - $1 and Up](https://audiojungle.net/)

![audiojungle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sound-effects-AudioJungle.JPG)

AudioJungle.net has a wide selection of royalty-free sound effects available for prices as low as $1\. Sound effects costing more than $10 tend to either be longer or include whole sets of sounds. You can filter the sounds on AudioJungle by category, tags, and price while you browse.

There are two different licenses you can purchase on AudioJungle, SFX Single Use, and SFX Multi-Use. The prices displayed are all for the Single Use license. The Multi-Use license costs more.

The main difference between the two licenses on AudioJungle is how many projects you can use your sound effect in. If you purchase a sound under a Single-Use license you can only use it in one project. You can use it as many times as you want within that project, and you can even make money off of that project, but you cannot use it again in a second project unless you repurchase it. While it is more expensive, the Multi-Use license gives you unlimited use of your download.

If you decide to use sound effects from any of these sites then please make sure to read their more detailed legal information.

### 4.[Free Sound Effects](https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/airplane-10004/)

It requires a one-time fee and you get access to use the sound effects as many times you want for your projects. But, if you are not really serious and just creating videos out of fun, you may also try the free sound effects like animals, applause, cars, etc. to ensure good vlog sound effects that can give life to your vlog.
