[5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Video Optimization \[Free Checklist\] >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 1\. Be Specific About Your YouTube Posting Schedule

Don’t just say you’re going to post a new video every week, decide on a specific day and time. If your subscribers expect new posts from you Thursdays at 4 pm, they will check your channel for those new posts every Thursday at 4 pm. This will make it easier for you to keep your view count close to your subscriber count.

The other benefit of being specific about your posting time is that the more specific you are, the less wiggle room you give yourself. Setting a clear deadline with yourself makes it harder to procrastinate.

## 2\. Make Your YouTube Upload Schedule Public

Post your schedule somewhere potential subscribers can see it like in your channel banner, intro, or video descriptions. The reason schedules work as a tool for growth is that they allow your audience to build up anticipation. It will be easier for newcomers to your channel to feel that anticipation if you start setting expectations for them on their first visit.

Committing publicly to a posting schedule means making a promise to your viewers. If you break that promise, they will be disappointed. This social pressure should help to keep you posting consistently.

## 3\. Remember That Posting on YouTube Takes Time

When you decide what day you want to post on, make sure that it’s a day where you have a lot of time to spend on things like writing your description, promoting your video, and answering comments.

It might be helpful to set a private deadline for yourself the day before your official post to upload your video and enter all of your metadata (title, description, tags). Then you can keep the video private until it’s time to post. You might also want to check out these tips on [how to export and upload faster](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## 4\. Bank YouTube Videos

It might happen that one week you’re full of ideas and energy and making videos is a breeze. It can be tempting to abandon your schedule and post more than normal, but you should resist that urge. Don’t waste all that energy – make the videos – but instead of posting them all right away, you should save them for weeks where you aren’t feeling the same enthusiasm.

## 5\. Set Realistic Goals

Your schedule shouldn’t leave you feeling burnt out. When you’re coming up with your schedule, think realistically about how much time you have to devote to YouTube and how much time you need to spend on a video. Give yourself enough time that you can keep to your schedule without feeling rushed.

Never make your schedule based on what other YouTubers are doing. Your lives are different.

Posting once a week is a good standard schedule, but if you like to spend a lot of time editing your videos and you work full time then maybe once a week isn’t realistic for you. Maybe you should post once every two weeks.

## The Best Days and Times to Post to YouTube

The best times to post are **Thursdays** and **Fridays** between 12 and 3pm (in the time zone of the majority of your subscribers – just check analytics in your Creator Studio). These are the times when there are the most viewers available to watch your videos. Monday and Tuesday are the worst days to post.

_Amy's scheduling advice: don't bite off more than you can chew!_

So, how many times do you upload per week, or per month? How often should you upload to YouTube?

There is a lot of information online and in books about the stock market and how to make intelligent investments, but Youtube channels seem to be where most investors get their information from. This might be due to how easily information is passed to the listener.

In this article, we will talk about the best Youtube channels for the stock market. We will list the top fourteen channels that will definitely help you make the most out of your investment, whether you are looking for short or long-term investments.

#### In this article

This is one of the best Youtube channels for stock market beginners. Sasha Evdakov is a great teacher and can introduce the hardest topics to everyone, regarding their level of knowledge in the stock market.

By going through his first videos, you'll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022\. He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.

### 2.[Investors Underground](https://www.youtube.com/user/investorsunderground)

Investors Underground is a 145K subscriber stock market channel based in the U.S. A great plus of this channel is its live chat and great instructional videos.
