If you’re looking to shoot your videos with interchangeable lenses, your camera set up will either have to have a mirrorless camera body or a DSLR camera body. In this post, I’ll be comparing the two camera body types for recording video.

![DSLR Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera.jpg)

DSLR cameras are digital single-lens reflex cameras. Like 35mm film cameras of the past, DSLR cameras are built with an angled mirror inside its camera body. This mirror allows you to look into your camera’s optical viewfinder and see exactly what your camera sees.

The mirror inside a DSLR camera flips up out of the way when you open the shutter to allow light to reach the camera’s image sensor.

## What is a Mirrorless Camera?

![Mirrorless Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-camera.jpg)

Mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras without a mirror inside the camera body. With nothing to reflect your image, you won’t find any optical viewfinder to look through to see exactly what your camera sees.

Light passes through the lens of a mirrorless camera and lands directly onto the camera’s sensor.

Check out our list of the [8 Best Mirrorless Cameras For Vlogging](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Mirrorless vs. DSLR - a Complete Comparison

#### Size and Weight

DSLR cameras are larger and heavier than mirrorless cameras because there are more parts that go into their camera bodies. DSLR cameras require enough space inside for an angled mirror to flip up out of the way.

If your video shooting style is more on-the-go, like that of a daily vlogger or travel vlogger, the smaller size and lighter weight of a mirrorless camera may be more suitable for you.

#### Previewing Images

When you’re using a DSLR camera, your optical viewfinder will show you exactly what your camera sees as opposed to a digital preview of what your image sensor picks up. No matter how bright or dark your scene actually is, through the optical viewfinder, you’ll be able to clearly see what your camera sees with the power of your eye.

Mirrorless cameras, on the other hand, display on your camera’s screen or electronic viewfinder a digital preview of what your camera is looking at. You will notice a lag, especially in low light, between actions that are taking place in front of the camera and the same actions being displayed in your live preview.

#### Lenses and Accessories

Having been around much longer, there are plenty more options for lenses and accessories when it comes to shooting with DSLR cameras. You can choose from all kinds of different quality levels and price ranges.

#### Video Resolution

4K video recording is more readily available in mirrorless cameras than DSLR cameras. At a much more affordable budget, you can get your hands on a 4K mirrorless camera. If you want to shoot 4K video on a DSLR camera, though, you will have to pay for some of the most expensive DSLR cameras on the market.

#### Image Stabilization

Up until quite recently, you needed to get the right lens with built-in optical image stabilization if you wanted to shoot stabilized photos and videos with an interchangeable lens camera. Image stabilization had not been readily available in the bodies of these cameras.

In recent years, however, mirrorless cameras have been much more active in their development of camera bodies equipped with shifting image sensors. Your shots can be even more stabilized when the optical image stabilization of your lens is combined with your camera’s in-body sensor-shift image stabilization.

#### Battery Life

When it comes to shooting video, DSLR cameras and mirrorless cameras consume about the same amount of power. It’s still safe to say, though, that DSLR cameras, for the most part, have better battery life than mirrorless cameras because their bigger batteries are packed with more power.

## Mirrorless vs. DSLR - Which One is Better for Video?

In my opinion, when it comes to filming a video, mirrorless cameras are the way to go. In such a short time, mirrorless cameras have made huge leaps in their capabilities. It won’t be long before the ultimate vlogging camera comes out on the mirrorless market.
