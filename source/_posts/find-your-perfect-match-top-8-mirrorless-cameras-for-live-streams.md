 | ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best daily mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 is Canon's first mirrorless camera that comes equipped with both a fully-articulated screen and an external microphone jack. It came out only a few months ago and is already considered one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. The M50 is also the only camera on our list that you can buy at a prosumer's budget that shoots 4K video. Yes, the Sony a7R III and Panasonic GH5S also shoot 4K video, but they are much more expensive. With Canon's new DIGIC 8 Image Processor, the camera's dual-pixel autofocusing system will perform even better.  **PROS** _\- Can shoot UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ![Mirrorless Cameras 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-4.png) | Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 is a small, but powerful mirrorless camera for vlogging. This camera can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It cannot shoot 4K video, unfortunately. It uses its DIGIC 7 Image Processor and dual-pixel autofocusing system to ensure that your vlogs are always in focus. The M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options - it can reach up to ISO 25600. With its built-in Wi-Fi with NFC, you can transfer your media seamlessly to a computer.  **PROS** _\- Affordable_ _\- Great connectivity options_   **CONS** _\- Lacks advanced video recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 wins this category as well in our books. It is the only camera on our list that shoots 4K video that is priced much lower than the Sony a7R III and the Panasonic GH7S. In case you missed it, check out my review on the [Canon EOS M50](#Best-daily-mirrorless-camera-for-vlogging).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Mirrorless Cameras 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-2.png) | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S Originally, Panasonic had released it's GH5 as a hybrid camera that handles both photography and videography well. In response to hearing customers' interest in a more video-focused camera, Panasonic came up with the GH5S. In our list of the top mirrorless cameras, the Panasonic GH5S and the Sony a7R III are the two professional mirrorless cameras that can record 4K video. Between the two, though, the GH5S wins as the best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging because it sports a fully-articulated screen. Its micro four-thirds sensor is smaller than the a7R III's full-frame sensor. Even with a smaller sensor, though, the GH5S is made to still autofocus well in low lighting conditions. Another amazing feature is its ability to record 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD 1080p.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

 | ![Mirrorless Cameras 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png) | Best daily mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 is Canon's first mirrorless camera that comes equipped with both a fully-articulated screen and an external microphone jack. It came out only a few months ago and is already considered one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. The M50 is also the only camera on our list that you can buy at a prosumer's budget that shoots 4K video. Yes, the Sony a7R III and Panasonic GH5S also shoot 4K video, but they are much more expensive. With Canon's new DIGIC 8 Image Processor, the camera's dual-pixel autofocusing system will perform even better.  **PROS** _\- Can shoot UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This camera can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It cannot shoot 4K video, unfortunately. It uses its DIGIC 7 Image Processor and dual-pixel autofocusing system to ensure that your vlogs are always in focus. The M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options - it can reach up to ISO 25600.

| ![Mirrorless Cameras 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-2.png) | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S Originally, Panasonic had released it's GH5 as a hybrid camera that handles both photography and videography well. In response to hearing customers' interest in a more video-focused camera, Panasonic came up with the GH5S. In our list of the top mirrorless cameras, the Panasonic GH5S and the Sony a7R III are the two professional mirrorless cameras that can record 4K video. Between the two, though, the GH5S wins as the best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging because it sports a fully-articulated screen. Its micro four-thirds sensor is smaller than the a7R III's full-frame sensor. Even with a smaller sensor, though, the GH5S is made to still autofocus well in low lighting conditions. Another amazing feature is its ability to record 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD 1080p.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
