It is one of the best travel YouTube channels to give you tips for traveling abroad on a shoestring budget. The channel is hosted by three friends and features tons of hacks to save your money while traveling.

#### 3\.  Drew Binsky

With over 1 billion views, Drew hosts one of the biggest travel-related YouTube channels. He started his channel with an aim to travel to every country in the world and records his experience on his channel. He is on the verge of completing his goal and you can join him too on his channel.

#### 4\.  100 Countries with Kara and Nate

As the name suggests, this is a dedicated travel channel that is owned by a couple, Kara and Nate. They started the channel with their mission to cover 100 countries by 2020, which they recently achieved. One of the reasons why they get millions of views on their videos is their authenticity. They share genuine travel experience on their channel that their viewers like the most.

#### 5\.  Vagabrothers

One of the best travel YouTube channels, it is owned by two brothers, Marko and Alex. Their travel videos are aesthetically pleasing and have a documentary style, elevating their overall visual appeal. If you are looking for an authentic experience, then you should check them out.

#### 6\.  Miss Mina

Having the best of food and travel in one place, this YouTube channel is owned by Mina Oh. The Korean YouTuber started her journey from authentic Asian food and gradually made travel videos. Today, she has almost a million subscribers with her videos having a blend of food and travel in one place.

#### 7\.  Best Ever Food Review Show

Owned by Sonny Side, this is one of the best travel YouTube channels, which is more inclined towards food. The host travels to various parts of the world and covers some of the most unique cuisines of that place. With over 5 million subscribers, Sonny is loved by many for his interesting take of different cultures and the food-related challenges he takes.

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Travel Video?

Now when you have got a glimpse of some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired to create your content as well. To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.

#### Record tons of footage

Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.

#### Focus on one thing at a time

While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.

#### Add voiceovers

A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.

#### Edit your videos with an excellent video editor

If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using **Wondershare Filmora**, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.

#### Be authentic

In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others. Try not to overly glorify a thing or provide a partial experience in your travel videos. Be authentic and share your experience while traveling to come up with personal yet beautifully-shot videos.

I’m sure that after reading this post on some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired as well. You can watch these channels to know more about a destination you are planning to visit or learn how to make interesting travel videos. To edit your videos, you can just take the assistance of a reliable application like Filmora and come up with stunning clips in less time.
