**Top 1: savefrom.net**

Savefrom.net is a very straightforward video download site, and the most convenient way to download videos with this site tool is just simply add "ss" in front of "youtube.com" in the video url. i.e. change www.youtube.com/xxx to www.ssyoutube.com/xxx and then hit Enter, you will come to the download page.

 **Top 2 savemedia.com**

Seems like savemedia.com has already merged with keep-tube. You don't need to copy and paste URL to download videos with this video download sites either, simply replace the url youtube.com/xxx with savemedia.com/xxx and you will be redirected to the video download page of savemedia.com. It also has the desktop downloader called Vdownloader. Sometimes when the site tool doesn't work, you can try Vdownloader to download videos.

**Top 3 savevideo.me** 

It does't say on this video download site that it supports to download videos, and if you try to copy and paste the url of a video on this site, it is also unable to analyze the URL. However, there is a simple workaround way, if you add the word "magic" between "you" and "tube" like www.youmagictube.com/xxx, you will be able to jump to the downloading page! Strange isn't it. And this video download site also support to download MP3 audio directly and supports other video sites such as Dailymotion, Vine, etc. But be aware of the ads in case you accidently click it.
