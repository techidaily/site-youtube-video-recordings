## Part 1: What is YouTube affiliate marketing?

In YouTube affiliate marketing, videos are made to encourage customers to purchase products from third-party sites including Amazon.

When users buy products via your links, you can receive commission, which can be up to 10% depending on the category of the product and how much you are selling.

Examples of YouTube affiliate marketing videos include reviews, how-to guides, un-boxing videos and more. Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.

When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.

Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.

Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.

## Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project

### Step 1: build affiliate relationship

One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.

Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.

If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.

![affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG)

### Step 2: Create your product video

The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.

Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.

Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.

![product video YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG)

### Step 3: Promote your content

There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.

Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.

![promote YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG)

## Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin

### 1\. Commission Rate

All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.

![comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG)

### 2\. Where affiliate links appear

Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.

It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.

![affiliate links](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG)

### 3\. Know your product well

It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.

You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.

![know product](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG)

## Conclusion

There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing. You may be amazed to see just how much cash you can generate when you follow the above steps and create inspiring videos that showcase products in the best possible light. Just remember to be honest and talk about the cons as well as the pros if they are any. Doing this will help you become a trusted, authentic YouTube affiliate marketer. Why wait any longer to get started?

## Part 1: 3 Awesome YouTube Name Generators

Need some help brainstorming your channel name? Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.

#### 1\. [SpinXO](http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/)

**Key points:**

 \- Lots of options

 \- Checks availability

This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.

Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:

![youtube name generator spinxo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg)

Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.

One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.

![youtube name generator spinxo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg)

#### 2\. [Name Generator](http://www.namegenerator.biz/youtube-name-generator.php)

**Key points:**

 **\-**  Can be hilarious

 **\-**  Names tend to be a bit long

This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:

![YouTube Name Generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg)

So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:

![YouTube Name Generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg)

You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.

#### 3\. [Username Generator](http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/)

**Key points:**

 **\-**  Can generate a huge number of names at once

 **\-**  You only input one word

For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.

![Username Generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg)

The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:

![Username Generator Sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator-generated.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps

The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:

1. Tell viewers what your channel is about
2. Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique

Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!

#### **Step 1: Gather up relevant words**

Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.

You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).

#### **Step 2: Combinations**

Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.

Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.

#### **Step 3: Say it out loud**

Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good. Ideally, you want to get that ‘oh, that has a nice ring to it!’ feeling.

## Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name

In the early days of YouTube, you couldn’t change your name, but now you can!

1. Click on your account icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose settings.
2. Click **Edit on Google**.
3. Update your name and click **OK**.

## Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube

Here are several [types of YouTube channel URL](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of a string of numbers and letters, your channel URL included your name? YouTube can do that for you!

You need…

1. 100 Subscribers
2. to have been on YouTube for 30 days
3. use a photo as your channel icon/profile picture
4. have uploaded channel art

Here’s how to get your custom URL:

1. Click on your icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose **Advanced** under **Settings**  / the gear icon.
2. If you meet the qualifications above, you’ll see   **‘You’re eligible for a custom URL’**  under **Channel Settings**.
3. YouTube will show you the custom URL you’re approved for in the **Get a custom URL**  box. You can’t change what’s there, but you can add to the end of it.
4. Click **Change URL**  after reading the terms of use.

You can delete your custom URL and claim a new one, but doing this might be confusing for your followers.

If you already have a YouTube channel name – are you happy with it? How did you choose it?

#### 2\. [Name Generator](http://www.namegenerator.biz/youtube-name-generator.php)

**Key points:**

 **\-**  Can be hilarious

 **\-**  Names tend to be a bit long

This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:

So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:

You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.

#### 3\. [Username Generator](http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/)

**Key points:**

 **\-**  Can generate a huge number of names at once

 **\-**  You only input one word

For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.

The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes. Here’s what I got:

## Part 2: How to Come Up With a Good YouTube Name – 3 Easy Steps

The name of your YouTube channel needs to accomplish two things:

1. Tell viewers what your channel is about
2. Stick in viewer’s heads by being catchy and unique

Here’s how you can brainstorm the perfect name for your channel!

#### **Step 1: Gather up relevant words**

Open up a journal (or a word document) and start writing down words that relate to you and your channel.

You may want to make one list of ‘you’ words (personality traits, nicknames, titles, etc.) and another of words related to your channel’s category (i.e. gaming, makeup, or baking).

#### **Step 2: Combinations**

Start combining your ‘you’ words with your category words to see what sounds good. You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.

Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.

#### **Step 3: Say it out loud**

Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good. Ideally, you want to get that ‘oh, that has a nice ring to it!’ feeling.

## Part 3: How to Change Your YouTube Name

In the early days of YouTube, you couldn’t change your name, but now you can!

1. Click on your account icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose settings.
2. Click **Edit on Google**.
3. Update your name and click **OK**.

## Part 4: Requesting a Custom URL for YouTube

Here are several [types of YouTube channel URL](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of a string of numbers and letters, your channel URL included your name? YouTube can do that for you!

You need…

1. 100 Subscribers
2. to have been on YouTube for 30 days
3. use a photo as your channel icon/profile picture
4. have uploaded channel art

Here’s how to get your custom URL:

1. Click on your icon in the top right corner of YouTube and choose **Advanced** under **Settings**  / the gear icon.
2. If you meet the qualifications above, you’ll see   **‘You’re eligible for a custom URL’**  under **Channel Settings**.
3. YouTube will show you the custom URL you’re approved for in the **Get a custom URL**  box. You can’t change what’s there, but you can add to the end of it.
4. Click **Change URL**  after reading the terms of use.

You can delete your custom URL and claim a new one, but doing this might be confusing for your followers.

If you already have a YouTube channel name – are you happy with it? How did you choose it?
