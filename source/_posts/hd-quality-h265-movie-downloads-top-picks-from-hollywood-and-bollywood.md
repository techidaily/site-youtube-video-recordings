## H.265/HEVC Movies Download from Hollywood/Bollywood

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 27, 2020 

The demand of **HEVC movies download** has been rapidly increasing as HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) can encode a video with about half the size of AVC at the same quality level, or substantially improve video quality at the same bit rate in the same size, meaning that you can play highly-compressed movies on different platforms like Windows PC, Mac, and iPhone/Android smoothly without worrying about the image quality as well as storage space. However, the provided small size HEVC movies on many websites are often fake or not in full length and there is no specific mobile app for H.265/HEVC movies download. So, where and how to free download HD 4K H.265/HEVC movies for PC or mobile? Just go on to find the answer.

## How to Find Trustworthy H.265/HEVC Movie Resources?

As is known to all that there is no software to compress 1 or 2 GB of a movie into some MB and it is not possible to get good quality movies in sizes lower than 300MB, so you should at least download 300MB movies to ensure the video quality. Besides, many sites claim that they offer free HEVC movies in small video sizes to download, but in reality you will find that most of them are spamy sites. Some of them will redirect you to the 18+ sites, some of them will lead you to selling pages, and some of them are just broken links. To not lead to pixelated video output and choppy frame rates, and help you find the trustworthy HEVC movies download sites to get Hollywood and Bollywood movies in different resolution like 720p, 1080p, 4K and in small file size less than 1GB, we suggest you to refer to:

**2\. x265/HEVC Movies Sites:** There are many video movie sites like www.x265tv.com offering small size HEVC 100MB/200MB/300MB etc. movies only where you can find plenty of H.265/HEVC resources for mobiles and PC.
