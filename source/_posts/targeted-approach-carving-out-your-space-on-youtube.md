## **What is a Niche?**

 A niche is what makes your channel unique.

When you are finding a niche for your YouTube channel, you are looking for a subset of a genre, subject, or topic to make videos about.

A niche can be broad like a channel about traveling.

Or more focused such as a channel only about traveling for food.

Then it can be hyper-focused such as a channel only about traveling for street food.

When people talk about “niching down,” they mean getting more focused on an area of a broader topic.

## **Why Do You Need a Niche on YouTube?**

#### **1\. Discoverability**

Having a niche differentiates your channel from all the other ones on YouTube. There is no denying the crowded space on the video platform. Every minute, [300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube](https://merchdope.com/youtube-statistics/). If you were simply copying other YouTubers, it will be challenging to grow, as your content will be in the shadows of all the other ones.

#### **2\. Consistency**

By having a consistent niche, your channel will be more coherent for those who discovered your awesome content and wants more related videos. If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.

For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.

#### **3\. Credibility**

In a specialized niche, you can own it and become an expert on the topic. Increasing your credibility will allow you to build trust much faster with your audience and therefore, grow at a much faster rate.

## **Finding Your Niche on YouTube**

#### **What Is Your Objective On YouTube?**

Do you want to make money? Do you want to fuel a passion? Do you want to educate the masses?

Your intentions on YouTube can be a numbers game: you want to get views, subscribers, and make money.

Or perhaps your intentions on YouTube can be to make content for a specific audience so that you can build a community.

Moreover, you might be using YouTube as the platform to showcase your personal brand and develop a reputation that you can bring to the real world.

Once you have a clear objective for what you want to achieve on YouTube, then you can consider the tactical direction to take your channel in: finding a niche and creating content for it.

#### **What is Your Passion?**

Building a YouTube channel is a grind and if you are not passionate about the topics you are covering in your niche, you may not have the motivation needed to churn out videos day after day, week after week.

Answering what you are passionate about isn’t enough to form your niche around, but it is definitely a critical part. [Start by finding your passion.](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-your-passion.html)

Think of the things that you can do for hours without getting bored. Think of the hobbies you have where you put in hours and hours to improve. Think about all the research you’ve done on a given topic for no other reason than satisfying your own curiosity. These can all help you understand what you are most passionate about.

Knowing your passion opens an avenue for you to travel down in discovering your niche. But the journey isn’t over yet… there are few more questions to ask:

#### **What Are Your Expertises?**

Over the course of your life, you have gained experiences and skills — and you might not even know it. Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.

While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?

If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.

#### **What Do People Know You For?**

If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?

If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.

Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.

Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.

Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:

\- Can I teach people what I know?

\- Will I want to learn more about this topic?

\- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?

Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:

#### **What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?**

If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.

When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:

\- Educate

\- Entertain

\- Inspire

#### **Educate Your Audience**

Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question. If your content can teach, it will be valuable because it has real-world applications. (example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)

#### **Entertain Your Audience**

Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)

#### **Inspire Your Audience**

Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)

Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic. If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.

Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video. If you want to become an idea machine, read this blog: [How to Come Up With Better YouTube Video Ideas](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html)

How does YouTube count views? It’s not as simple as the number of clicks your video gets. If someone sits and refreshes your video over and over without letting it play for any significant time, those refreshes won’t be recorded as views. There is a lot more that goes into the calculation.

## Best YouTube Video Editor - Filmora

After you have created your YouTube channel, do you want to edit videos and upload your first video? Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.

You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros. It includes more than 500 templates, transitions, effects, and text resources.

## 1\. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count

YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a [full 30 seconds need to be viewed](https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9) to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.

![how YouTube counts view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG)

## 2\. How Does YouTube Count Views?

YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.

Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.

At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.

## 3\. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?

Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.

There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.

If you upload a video and then [set it as unlisted](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.

You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.

However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.

We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.

Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.

## 4\. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don't Count

Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.

One way that [YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en) is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).

Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.

## 5\. The Skip & Skim

It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.

## 6\. Frozen YouTube View Counts

Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.

You can use [YouTube’s analytics reports](https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/) to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.

## 7\. The 301 Mark

You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.

This is why view counts are often frozen at 301\. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.

During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, [YouTube says](https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away) it won't flag videos at 301 views anymore.

## Conclusion

In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.

This is why view counts are often frozen at 301\. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.

During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, [YouTube says](https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away) it won't flag videos at 301 views anymore.

## Conclusion

In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.
