## Part 1: Get More Views by Adding Shorts Video to the ‘Featured’ Section

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the ‘Featured’ videos are suggested according to what YouTube ‘thinks’ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a ‘Featured’ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the ‘Recommended’ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the ‘Featured’ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the ‘Featured’ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PC’s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as ‘Featured’ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos aren’t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding ‘#Shorts’ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the ‘Featured’ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channel’s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

On the other hand, the ‘Featured’ videos are suggested according to what YouTube ‘thinks’ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a ‘Featured’ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the ‘Recommended’ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the ‘Featured’ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the ‘Featured’ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PC’s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as ‘Featured’ after its approval.

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos aren’t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding ‘#Shorts’ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the ‘Featured’ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channel’s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

One of the greatest problems facing many YouTube creators is capturing views. It's hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.

Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.

**View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:** be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube's Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading. If you want safer options, scroll down to 'Alternatives to Bots.'

## What Is A YouTube View Bot?

Bots work in an automated sense, just like software, and they can run in the background. Bots automatically add views to your videos.

Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.

## Why Use a YouTube View Bot?

Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as 'social proof' of the video's quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don't have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.

Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.

## What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?

The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.

You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.

Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.

## Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?

 **Yes.**

Bots are against YouTube's TOS, especially for partners using AdSense ([learn more about YouTube's partnership program here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you've used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.

The biggest danger isn't YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don't persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube's algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven't watched them. The algorithm interprets that as 'the people clicking on this don't like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.

If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.

One of the greatest problems facing many YouTube creators is capturing views. It's hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.

Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.

**View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:** be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube's Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading. If you want safer options, scroll down to 'Alternatives to Bots.'

## What Is A YouTube View Bot?

Bots work in an automated sense, just like software, and they can run in the background. Bots automatically add views to your videos.

Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.

## Why Use a YouTube View Bot?

Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as 'social proof' of the video's quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don't have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.

Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.

## What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?

The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.

You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.

Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.

## Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?

 **Yes.**

Bots are against YouTube's TOS, especially for partners using AdSense ([learn more about YouTube's partnership program here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you've used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.

The biggest danger isn't YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don't persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube's algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven't watched them. The algorithm interprets that as 'the people clicking on this don't like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.

If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.

Using bots, or any of the services below, won't grow your channel more quickly than the tactics like [posting on a schedule](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html), [creating clickable thumbnails](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/6-tips-for-making-good-youtube-thumbnails---get-more-159.html), or [mastering SEO](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-youtube-video-trending-284.html). There can be some perks to using them - we won't deny that there are people who have benefitted from bots through a mixture of luck and careful strategy - but in general, it is better to focus your efforts on [your content](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html) and [solid YouTube strategies](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html).
