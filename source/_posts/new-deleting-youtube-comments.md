If it is your video where the comment to be removed is, you can go to My Channel from the profile icon on the right-hand side of the YouTube app’s homepage.

1. Once you locate the video, you need to find the comment you want to delete. On the YouTube app, you may need to scroll down for a while to do this.
2. When you reach it, click on the three vertical dots at the bottom corner of your comment. You should see an option called Delete. Click on that. You need to confirm once more that you want to delete it, and the process will be complete.

## Delete Other People’s Comments on Others’ Channels

Did you see a hate comment on your favorite creator’s video? Sadly, you cannot delete the comment. But, you can report it, and YouTube will hide or take it down.

You can do this both from your desktop or your phone with some easy steps.

**How to report people’s comments** **on YouTube?**

Go to <https://www.youtube.com/> from your desktop or open the YouTube app from your phone. Log in to your account if it is not open.

1. The next step is to find the video where the comment is. You can search for it by tapping on the search button at the top of the YouTube homepage. Or you can locate it from your YouTube History.

To find your History from your desktop, you need to click on the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the homepage. You will find the History option from the list. To access it from your phone, click on the Library option at the bottom of your homepage, and it will open a list where you will find the History option.

1. Open the video, and scroll down to locate the comment you want to report.
2. Once you find your target comment, click on the three vertical dots that appear on its right side. You will find the Report option from the pop-up menu. Click on that.
3. When you tap Report, another dialogue box will appear. From the list of options, choose the most appropriate option, tap on Report at the lower right corner of the pop-up, and complete the process. YouTube will do the rest.

## How to Delete All Your Posted YouTube Comments?

You can also delete all comments you ever posted on any YouTube video by hiding your channel. When you do this, you can hide your video content temporarily. But it will irreversibly erase all your comments throughout YouTube. If you are curious, read on to know how you can do it.

1. You need to go to YouTube from your desktop and sign in to your account.
2. Next, you can either click on the profile icon at the top right corner or the three horizontal lines beside the YouTube logo on your homepage. From the list of options, click Settings.

![   YouTube Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/two-ways-settings-youtube-channel.jpg)

1. YouTube will direct you to the Settings page of your account. Choose Advanced Settings from the list on your left. You can also access it from[here](https://www.youtube.com/account%5Fadvanced).

![   YouTube Advanced  Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advanced-settings.jpg)

1. Scroll down and select Delete Channel. Clicking it will not delete your account. When you click on Delete Channel, you will get two choices – ‘I want to hide my channel’ and ‘I want to permanently delete my content’. Select the first.

![   YouTube Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-content.jpg)

1. YouTube will now show you what will happen when you hide your channel. Check all the boxes to confirm that you understand, and then tap on Hide My Channel. YouTube will now delete all comments made by your account.

## Part 1: How to Remove YouTube Videos that You've Uploaded

**You may also like:**[How to Edit Uploaded YouTube Videos >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 The first thing that we are going to show you is how to remove your own videos. This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren't that interesting.

 The fact of the matter is that it's quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.

 Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you've uploaded.

![Video list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg)

 There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don't want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.

![remove youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg)

 That's pretty much it – there's nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.

## Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels

 Now that we've covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it's time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don't want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.

**You may also like:**[How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it's going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that's the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.

 You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it's invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it's easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.

![remove other's youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg)

 The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do. It's going to ensure that your channel is perfectly updated, aligned and structured while at the same time making sure that everything is in line with your privacy. YouTube is a powerful website, and you need to be able to stay in control in order to be protected.
