You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

## **1\. Free Stock Footage Archive

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmora’s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

## **2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

## **3\. HDStockFootageFree

This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.

## **4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

## What Is YouTube Studio?

YouTube Studio is a free, cloud-based video production software. It's the ideal way to create, distribute, and measure the overall success of your films on YouTube, Google+, and the web. It provides powerful editing tools, real-time feedback on how your films are performing, and one-click posting from your PC or smartphone. YouTube Studio provides several features:

#### 1\. Manages Multiple Channels

YouTube Studio makes managing a couple of channels a lot easier. You can see all of your channels on one screen and switch from one to the other without difficulty. Simply select Manage Channels from the account icon in the top right corner. When you have a lot of money owing to you, you can modify it.

#### 2\. Get Real-Time Data On Your Channels

The YouTube Studio app is most useful for creating fast, vlog-style videos, but it can also handle other types of material. With titles, photographs and captions, transitions, and even music, it could create a number of videos with different purposes.

#### 4\. Scheduled Video Uploads

A few films will need to be posted later, given a content creator's schedule or habit. When you're in the publishing section of your project, you'll see a visibility option that lets you schedule the release of your video.

#### 5\. Add more Users

It is possible to add partners to the studio if you are working on a project requiring teamwork. To make this option available, go to your settings and then adjust permissions. Authenticate the account you're using and click the + symbol to add other users.
