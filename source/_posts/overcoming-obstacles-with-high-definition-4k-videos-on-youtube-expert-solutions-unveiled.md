### Tips on How to Upload 4K Videos to YouTube

If you want to share on YouTube your self-made 4K videos, 2160p family movies and parodies, you’d better get to know some uploading rules set by YouTube and get a proper [YouTube 4K video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).   
**1:** File size: make sure that the size of your 4K file for YouTube uploading is within 2 gigabytes.  
**2:** File length: make certain that the length of the 4K videos for YouTube uploading is no longer than 15 minutes.   
**3:** File format: make your 4K videos in YouTube supported formats: MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, MKV, 3GP, MPEG, WMV, SWF, etc.  
**4:** Bitrate: it’s worth noticing that the maximum YouTube 4K bitrate is 45Mbps, which won’t work smoothly with 60fps 4K video.  
So, you'd better reset frame rate of your YouTube 4K video within 45fps or downsize it to 1080p.   
Note: you can make use of the YouTube 4K video converter to compre ss the file size within 2 gigabytes, adjust file formats and bitrate, as well as trim, crop or split the video longer than 15 minutes into smaller sections to fit in the rules with the help of a YouTube 4K video converter.
