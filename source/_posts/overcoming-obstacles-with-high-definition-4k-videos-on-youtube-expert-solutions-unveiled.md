## YouTube 4K 2160p Problem with Chrome

**Q**\- **YouTube 4K 2160p videos** always get choppy playbacks in Chrome version 39 in 64bits on iMac using Maverick or on a Windows 8.1 PC.  
**Q**\- "YouTube 4K UHD content lags so bad in Chrome 32 bit and looks like a PowerPoint presentation, 64 bit chrome has a lot less lag but it's still noticeable."  
**A1**: "In this situation, you can resort to other browsers like IE to solve this **YouTube 4K 2160p video problem** in Chrome. Without inbuilt flash, IE is forced to use HTML. On Windows 8 and above, it plays YouTube 4K resolution videos through HTML5 very smoothly. Chrome, on the contrary, with built-in flash, can often result in choppy and lagging playback as it uses flash most of the time."  
**A2**: "Or, you can download 4K Ultra HD videos for no-network enjoyment through 5KPlayer which supports 4K UHD video download and YouTube 4K playback."

### Tips on How to Upload 4K Videos to YouTube

If you want to share on YouTube your self-made 4K videos, 2160p family movies and parodies, you’d better get to know some uploading rules set by YouTube and get a proper [YouTube 4K video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).   
**1:** File size: make sure that the size of your 4K file for YouTube uploading is within 2 gigabytes.  
**2:** File length: make certain that the length of the 4K videos for YouTube uploading is no longer than 15 minutes.   
**3:** File format: make your 4K videos in YouTube supported formats: MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, MKV, 3GP, MPEG, WMV, SWF, etc.  
**4:** Bitrate: it’s worth noticing that the maximum YouTube 4K bitrate is 45Mbps, which won’t work smoothly with 60fps 4K video.  
So, you'd better reset frame rate of your YouTube 4K video within 45fps or downsize it to 1080p.   
Note: you can make use of the YouTube 4K video converter to compre ss the file size within 2 gigabytes, adjust file formats and bitrate, as well as trim, crop or split the video longer than 15 minutes into smaller sections to fit in the rules with the help of a YouTube 4K video converter.
