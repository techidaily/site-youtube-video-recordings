**Be precise:** Condense all the important details in your video and ensure the background music aligns with the theme.

**Think widely:** Check at what others are adding to their Shorts. You can include memes and other entertaining clips.

**Post videos more often:** Since YouTube Shorts are short videos that can’t accommodate so much information, try to post your videos more often so that your viewers follow up closely on what you are putting across.

**Use catchy music:** It doesn’t mean that the latest singles are more catchy or viral. Songs from a few years ago can also be equally catchy.

#### 8\. How are YouTube Shorts different from other short-form videos?
