YouTube Creator Summit has been held for several years. In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.

Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.

_Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures._

The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.

_Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out_ [_he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY)_._

Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.

_Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room._

There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:

## 1\. A map of Dumbo

The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.

_Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo._

Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.

## 2\. Post Cards

One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.

## 3\. S’well bottle

S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45\. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention/conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.

## 4\. Branded slippers

To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.

![Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg)

_thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers._

## 5\. Pins, pins, pins

There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.

## 6\. Denim jacket

A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.

_![Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg)_

_Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit._

Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!

As a Youtuber, the first thing you would want is to achieve is a high number of views on your videos. One of the most crucial factors that determine whether the video will be a success or not is the thumbnail.

 You need to design an attractive youtube custom thumbnail as it can up your game and get you significantly more views. this calls for you to exercise your artistic skills to the best, to be able to create thumbnails that make it almost irresistible for the viewers to scroll down without watching the video.

However, if you are wondering how that can be achieved then fret no longer for this article will explain the simple process of creating youtube thumbnails easily. All you need is a capable thumbnail maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that can do it all for you in one automagical flourish!

![youtube thumbnail mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/youtube-thumbnail-mac.jpg)

## What is a Youtube Thumbnail?

A youtube thumbnail is a smaller version of the video, a snapshot that you choose as a preview of your video. A Thumbnail is extremely important because it is essentially the outer packaging of your video; its front cover.

Much like the cover of a book, a thumbnail has to be attractive so that it can tempt your potential viewers to stop and watch your video while they are scrolling on youtube.

thumbnails are a significant factor in determining the number of views a Youtuber gets on his videos.

If you don’t create a thumbnail then youtube will generate one by itself which may not be so enticing for viewers. The purpose of the thumbnail is to make your videos stand out among the rest so you need to pay attention to it!

## How to make Youtube Thumbnails on Mac

You can easily create interesting thumbnails for youtube videos using a thumbnail maker like[FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . Here is a step by step guide:

### 1. Preview the video and choose the still snapshot

The first step in creating a thumbnail is to import the final video into the FilmoraX editor on your MacBook.

![import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/3.import-media-files.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Then, use the thumbnail editor to play your video and choose the snapshot that you want to be appearing as your thumbnail.

You can easily choose the frame from the video or use the preview frame button to view the frames one by one!

![thumbnails editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/thumbnails-editor.jpg)

### 2. Add text, shape, and image overlays

Once you’ve chosen the frame for the thumbnail, the next step would be to add text to it to catch the attention of the audience. You can also adjust the thumbnail size as per your requirement, however, the ideal size would be 1280x720 pixels with a minimum width of 640 pixels.

![add text on thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/add-text-on-thumbnail.jpg)

### 3. Add effects

![filter9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filter-9-mac.jpg)

### 4. Save the thumbnail

Once you save you’ll see how your thumbnail will feature on different platforms like Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter.

So, using this thumbnail maker you can easily create custom thumbnails for your videos!

#### Conclusion

Hopefully, the above-mentioned steps have given you enough insight and clarity on making creative and good youtube thumbnails. Using [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will further simplify the process for you with its amazing tools and features!
