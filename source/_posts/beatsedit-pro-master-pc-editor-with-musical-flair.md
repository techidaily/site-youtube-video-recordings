## How to Use YouTube Enhancements

 First of all, you need to locate YouTube Enhancements. As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.

![Locate enhancements features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg )

 Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.

![Qucik Fix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg )

 Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.

![YouTube Filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg )

 Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.

![YouTube Costum Blurring](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg )

 Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.

## How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos

* Open Wordershare Filmora

 YouTube has integrated a free video editor to facilitate the work of YouTubers and allow them to process their videos prior to uploading. Although nobody can claim these features can live up to the sophisticated features of the professional video editors, YouTube enhancements are useful and cool which offer a simple way to improve the quality of the videos and do not require any technical knowledge on your behalf.

* [Part 1: How to Use YouTube Enhancements](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Use Wondershare Filmora to Improve Video Qualtiy](#part2)

## How to Use YouTube Enhancements

 First of all, you need to locate YouTube Enhancements. As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.

![Locate enhancements features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg )

 Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.

![Qucik Fix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg )

 Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.

![YouTube Filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg )

 Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.

![YouTube Costum Blurring](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg )

 Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.

## How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos

 These are the steps that you need to follow, so as to proceed with high-quality video editing on Filmora:

* Open Wordershare Filmora
* Choose if you want 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio
* Tap Import so as to upload the files
* Drag and drop them, in order to place them in the right order

![Import Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg )

* Click Edit and adjust the settings (rotation, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, auto de-noise and speed)

![Adjust Contrast Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg )

* Click OK, and you are done with the improvement of Video Quality

 If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:

* Tap the Effect button
* Drag the effect you want to use on the timeline (you can choose from a wide variety of effects, including Bokeh and Light Leaks, Old Film, etc.)

![Free Movie Special Effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-movie-special-effects.jpg )

 After having finished with the video editing process, you can preview the video and see if it is of acceptable quality standards. You can do that by clicking on the Play button. Then you can click on the Create button and save the video where you want, in the format of your choosing. It is also possible for you to burn the video on a DVD or share it online using YouTube or Facebook.
