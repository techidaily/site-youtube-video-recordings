Do you like the animated elements in Wondershare Filmora? Do you want to learn how to make your own?

A little while ago, we posted a list of YouTube channels where you could [get free green screen effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). All of these effects consisted of animations on green backgrounds. To use them, you pull the clip into the PIP track of your Filmora project and use the green screen feature to make the background transparent. It’s pretty easy.

In this post, we’re going to kick things up a bit. Here is a list of places where you can get free lessons on creating your own animated video effects.

**Animated Video Effect Courses:**

[Mt. Mograph](#mtmograph)

[Richard Harrington on Lynda](#lynda)

[Bloop Animation](#bloop)

[Video Copilot](#videocopilot)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 ![Video Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-video-effects.png)

 All of these resources will teach Adobe After Effects, or a similar paid software. If you do not have access to Adobe After Effects, you might want to check out our post on [affordable animation software for video creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-or-cheap-animation-software-for-video-creators-122.html).

## **[Mt. Mograph](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUSgx9qc%5FNydrOL59xbJIA)**

On this YouTube channel, motion graphics specialist Matt offers free animation tutorials using a variety of programs including Adobe After Effects and Cinema 4D. His lessons are for a range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced. If you are just starting out then Mt.Mograph is a great resource.

## **[Richard Harrington on Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Rich-Harrington/120-1.html)**

Lynda isn’t free, but the 10-day free trial period is definitely long enough for you to watch this two-hour course.

What’s great about this course is that it assumes you have no animation experience, and it walks you through the main thing a lot of YouTubers want to learn animation for – creating an animated logo.

## **[Bloop Animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/)**

 Most of the video animation courses on this site are paid, but they have a lot of cool free tutorials as well.

There’s even a playlist on title design, which will be useful for anyone looking to create an intro sequence for their videos.

## Bonus Tips: Factors to Consider for YouTube SEO

#### Use descriptive Title Tags (Description)

Be sure to use descriptive title tags; this helps YouTube determine what your video is about, and it increases the likelihood of it appearing in search results for related searches.

#### Place Keywords in Your Video Tags, Description, and Titles

It is imperative to include keywords in your video titles, descriptions, and tags. Essentially, this allows YouTube to know what the content of your videos is about so it can recommend them to an audience interested in similar topics or related searches.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

Once you have created great content, you need to share the videos with family and friends to enjoy them! By sharing these videos on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, you can help to increase their visibility.

#### Optimize Your Channel

After setting up an account on YouTube, you must optimize the rest of your profile; this includes adding a custom avatar picture, bio description, relevant links to other social media sites like Instagram or Twitter, and links to relevant external sites.

#### Use Filmora to Make High-quality YouTube Videos

One of the most effective ways to keep people glued to your channel is by giving them high-quality videos. Filmora can help you edit YouTube videos before publishing them on your YouTube channel.

## Bonus Tips: Factors to Consider for YouTube SEO

#### Use descriptive Title Tags (Description)

Be sure to use descriptive title tags; this helps YouTube determine what your video is about, and it increases the likelihood of it appearing in search results for related searches.

#### Place Keywords in Your Video Tags, Description, and Titles

It is imperative to include keywords in your video titles, descriptions, and tags. Essentially, this allows YouTube to know what the content of your videos is about so it can recommend them to an audience interested in similar topics or related searches.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

Once you have created great content, you need to share the videos with family and friends to enjoy them! By sharing these videos on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, you can help to increase their visibility.

#### Optimize Your Channel

After setting up an account on YouTube, you must optimize the rest of your profile; this includes adding a custom avatar picture, bio description, relevant links to other social media sites like Instagram or Twitter, and links to relevant external sites.

#### Use Filmora to Make High-quality YouTube Videos

One of the most effective ways to keep people glued to your channel is by giving them high-quality videos. Filmora can help you edit YouTube videos before publishing them on your YouTube channel. The basic editing abilities like rotate, merge, split, trim, or crop are made easy with its simple user interface.

This software has created the ability to present a higher level of editing quality with features that can change or add an immersed effect to your video content. A Text and Titles library allows you to create illustrations for your content without having to find options.

There is also a music library giving you the ability to focus on the emotion or theme you're attempting to create instead of spending time searching for royalty-free songs and different types of text to create the finished product you want.

You can give your videos an added effect with the inventory of handcrafted filters and overlays. To enhance these effects, you can also add transitions and motion elements.

Filmora is a one-stop shop with additional features like video stabilization and screen recording. Many other programs would require the use of separate software to make those types of adjustments. 3D Lut gives you access to different presets inspired by popular movies helping you reach your desired result.

YT SEO tools can help you optimize your videos to increase views and grow your following. Because people like to watch high-quality videos, you should use Filmora to make impressive videos to keep people coming to your channel.
