## Direct Link Between Spotify and YouTube: The Top Tools for Music Sharing

YouTube, as one of the most popular free streaming video portals, the majority of people use it, probably several times a day. However, how many of you know that there are more than 20 shortcuts that help you use the website comparatively more conveniently?

With that said, the following two-columned tables give you detailed information on the shortcut keys and their respective functions, so you don’t have to grab the mouse every time you want to navigate through the YouTube videos, or do any such similar tasks.

## Amazing YouTube Keyboard Shortcuts You May Not Know

To make things convenient for you, the shortcut keys are placed under their corresponding categories, where each category is in the form of a two-columned table.

### Category 1: YouTube Playback Hotkeys

While watching a YouTube video, there might be instances when you want to pause and resume the playback. This category teaches how this can be done using the keyboard:

| Keyboard Shortcut | Function                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 'K'               | Play and Pause (Works as a toggle key) |
| 'Spacebar'        | Play and Pause (Works as a toggle key) |

### Category 2: Scrolling YouTube Videos Back and Forth

This section talks about the shortcut keys to skim the video forward and backward during playback:

| Keyboard Shortcut                    | Function                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 'L'                                  | Skip the video 10 seconds forward                                                                                                                                            |

| '→' (Right Arrow)                    | Skip the video 5 seconds forward                                                                                                                                             |
| '←' (Left Arrow)                     | Skip the video 5 seconds backward                                                                                                                                            |
| 'SHIFT' + 'N'                        | Skip to the next video in the playlist or to the next suggested video                                                                                                        |
