## List of Top 10 English Christmas Songs

**★[Deck The Halls - Pentatonix](https://youtu.be/UqItlHUSN-4)**

It's been a tradition that we expect one more new Pentatonix English Christmas song every year and 2018 is no exception as we have Deck The Halls - a classical secular Christmas carol that's age-old, with its melody originated from Welsh, its tunes used by Mozart for his violin music, and its its lyrics of American origin, this English Christmas songs download is going to impress you for this Holiday season. 

**★[Hallelujah - Pentatonix](https://youtu.be/LRP8d7hhpoQ)**

Hallelujah by Pentatonix is indeed a work of genius which unfolds the homelike happiness of Christmas in a pop manner. Released on October 21, 2016, this English Christmas song touches the inner soft space of 70 million fans soon. This is no surprise if you can recall Pentatonix's excellent holiday-themed album released during the Christmas season 2014, if not yet, we'll include one single from it in the later part.

**★ [All I Want for Christmas' Carpool Karaoke | Christmas Songs Collaboration by Maria Carey, Lady Gaga, Adele & others](https://youtu.be/JKJExBXRorA)**

Instead of a classical English Christmas song - The Christmas special program from James Cap's Late Late show greet us quite in time and takes over the 2nd place in our recommendation. Not a feature-length song, this show is a collection of snippet from various big name artists including Maria Carey, Lady Gaga, Adele, Nick Jonas, John Elton, etc, altogether singing the classical "All I Want for Christmas is You". 

**★ [Beautiful Christmas - Big Time Rush](https://youtu.be/x7yqyj-Djlo)**

Released back in 2011, Beautiful Christmas by Big Time Rush shouldn't be a new English Christmas song for many, "Put down video games, pick up some candy canes, and hang a wreath on your door..." Big Time Rush can instantly crank out the abustle and astir holiday atmosphere with their music, now just download the English Christmas song and let it wipe out your worries!

**★ [That's Christmas To Me - Pentatonix](https://youtu.be/pFjdfjrtf1Q)** 

_"The fireplace is burning bright, shining all on me_ 
 _I see the presents underneath the good old Christmas tree_ 
 _And I wait all night_ 
 _'til Santa comes to wake me from my dreams_ 
 _Oh, why? 'Cause that's Christmas to me"._

The release of That's Christmas to Me in 2014 is like, wow, the concept "English Christmas songs" is rewritten from scratch - with heaven-like harmony, drama-like music video and cozy tunes, Pentatonic made the Xmas season more complete by way of their beautiful vocals. That perhaps, is another reason behind the success of the 2016 Christmas carol - Hallelujah.
