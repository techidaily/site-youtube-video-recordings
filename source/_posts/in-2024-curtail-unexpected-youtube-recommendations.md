YouTube is forever recommending videos for you whether it's in your dashboard or next to the video you're already watching. In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you're only directed to videos you're interested in.

Except we all know that’s not always what happens.

YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.

Here’s what you can do about it:

1. [**Manage Your Watch History**](#manage)
2. [**Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested**](#notinterested)
3. [**But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?**](#butwhy)

## Manage Your Watch History

![Manage Watch History](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg)

Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked **History** with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the **Account** tab and tap **History**.

You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.

If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.

## Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested

![Tell YouTube Not Interested](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg)

Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.

What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.

Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click **Not Interested**.

When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.

## But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?

Your search/watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch **time**.

Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn't closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you'll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that'll keep you around.

  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.

The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.

 Are you usually happy with YouTube's recommended videos?

## What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?

## Part 1: Best Wedding Videos on YouTube

#### 1.JK Wedding Entrance Dance

One of the funniest wedding videos you will ever see is this one right here. The video is packed with hilarious moments, especially the moves of those two gentlemen in the beginning. This is what we call a ‘different’ wedding celebration. If you want to do something out of the box, this can be a great idea.

#### 3.A Wedding That Will Move You

Oh! And this one! You can’t miss this heart-touching and beautiful wedding video. You will surely get moved and get goose bumps while watching this. The bride and the groom are so devoting to each other making this video no less than a fairytale. The boy started getting diagnosed with liver cancer. The last wish was to get married and the love between the couple made people compelled to make the hospital a church. The man died happily within 10 hours of wedding.

#### 4. My Wedding Speech

Among loads of stories available there, this is one of the best wedding videos ever. The groom’s speech is a song that truly makes the girl pleased and smile. Well the man gave us an idea that when speech bores you just write a song and sing it. The groom, with rewriting his lovely speech, oh we mean song, simply handles all the nervousness and touches each one’s heart in the crowd. Probably every girl in the world expects such an adorable man as her partner!

## Part 2: Best Wedding Videos on Vimeo

#### 1. The Wedding of London and Nathan

When there is such pure love between couple, they do look beautiful together. And the best wedding video naturally shows the love glowing on their faces. The groom’s brother expressed his touching childhood wish of having a baby sister. He said with his brother’s wedding, god has gifted him the sister he always so earnestly wished for. This melted the couple’s hearts. The blushing couple in every scene of the wedding video reminded of the fairytales that say ‘happily ever after’.

#### 2.IyaVillania and Drew Arellano’s Wedding

The white flowers, sunset, the cliff across the beach, what more could a bride ask for to make the wedding the most memorable event of her life. This is one such perfect wedding video, where the couple exchanged their own set of cute wedding vows. The sea in the backdrop was a testament of their beautiful love story unfolding under the golden dawn. And their first dance under the stars touched people’s hearts.

#### 3.Greatest wedding toast of all time

The most beautiful wedding videos often have a different kind of celebration. The groom’s friends raised the wedding toast in very different way adding more highlights to the celebrations. The newlywed couple kept on bursting with laughter with the toast being sung. Well! Those girls wrote the composition and dedicated it to the bride. How adorable that was! Everyone ended up dancing to their hilarious poem at the end.

#### 4.Kelly and Dustin

Watching the perfect wedding video always brings goose bumps, when you see the couple so in love with each other. They have exchanged love notes and got teary eyed reading them. What a romantic backdrop for a wedding that took place amidst greenery. The groom even surprised the bride with a gift hidden under the couch. The cutesy invites and the wonderful couple so in love made everything look breathtaking. The recent downpour made the surrounding looks so fresh and lively.

Well the man gave us an idea that when speech bores you just write a song and sing it. The groom, with rewriting his lovely speech, oh we mean song, simply handles all the nervousness and touches each one’s heart in the crowd. Probably every girl in the world expects such an adorable man as her partner!

#### 1. The Wedding of London and Nathan

When there is such pure love between couple, they do look beautiful together. And the best wedding video naturally shows the love glowing on their faces. The groom’s brother expressed his touching childhood wish of having a baby sister. He said with his brother’s wedding, god has gifted him the sister he always so earnestly wished for. This melted the couple’s hearts. The blushing couple in every scene of the wedding video reminded of the fairytales that say ‘happily ever after’.

#### 2.IyaVillania and Drew Arellano’s Wedding

The white flowers, sunset, the cliff across the beach, what more could a bride ask for to make the wedding the most memorable event of her life. This is one such perfect wedding video, where the couple exchanged their own set of cute wedding vows. The sea in the backdrop was a testament of their beautiful love story unfolding under the golden dawn. And their first dance under the stars touched people’s hearts.

#### 3.Greatest wedding toast of all time

The most beautiful wedding videos often have a different kind of celebration. The groom’s friends raised the wedding toast in very different way adding more highlights to the celebrations. The newlywed couple kept on bursting with laughter with the toast being sung. Well! Those girls wrote the composition and dedicated it to the bride. How adorable that was! Everyone ended up dancing to their hilarious poem at the end.

#### 4.Kelly and Dustin

Watching the perfect wedding video always brings goose bumps, when you see the couple so in love with each other. They have exchanged love notes and got teary eyed reading them. What a romantic backdrop for a wedding that took place amidst greenery. The groom even surprised the bride with a gift hidden under the couch. The cutesy invites and the wonderful couple so in love made everything look breathtaking. The recent downpour made the surrounding looks so fresh and lively.
