## Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?

Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016\. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.

They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.

## YouTube Shorts & TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?

Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.

### \- Similiarity

Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.

##### 1) Monetization

Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.

You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.

##### 2) Analytics

Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.

##### 3) Subscribe directly to creators

You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.

##### 4) Privacy

Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.

##### 5) Edit video

There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.

### \- Difference

##### 1) Instant messaging app

Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.

##### 2) In dependability

TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.

##### 3) Interface

With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.

### \- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need

Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.

Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.

TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.

YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.

### \- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need

Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.

Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.

TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.

YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.

## How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?

## Step-By-Step guide

**Step 1:** To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the "Sample Colors," select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.![subscribe-button1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png)

**Step 2:** Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.![subscribe-button2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png)

**Step 3:** Now it's time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.![subscribe-button3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png)

**Step 4:** Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.![subscribe-button4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png)

**Step 5:** Now, let's add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. "Basic 6" will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.![subscribe-button5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png)

**Step 6:** Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with "Subscribe" and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.![subscribe-button6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png)

**Step 7:** We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.![subscribe-button7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png)

**Step 8:** Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.![subscribe-button8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png)

**Step 9:** Now, it's time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let's animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the 'Animation' tab and then click 'Customize.' Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click 'Add.'![subscribe-button9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png)

**Step 10:** Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.![subscribe-button10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png)

**Step 11:** Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click 'ADVANCED.'![subscribe-button11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png)

**Step 12:** In this Advance text editor, go to the 'Animation' tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.![subscribe-button12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png)

**Step 13:** Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking 'Add'.![subscribe-button13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png)

**Step 14:** Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.![subscribe-button14](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png)

**Step 15:** To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.![subscribe-button15](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png)

**Step 16:** You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.![subscribe-button16](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png)

**Step 17:** Now it's time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.![subscribe-button17](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png)

**Step 18:** After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0\. It will make it disappear.![subscribe-button18](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png)

**Step 19:** Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.![subscribe-button19](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png)

Once your content is ready and you are getting many views, it is essential to make these potential viewers your permanent viewers. The animated subscribe button will help you achieve this goal. While your viewers are watching your videos, you must remind them about subscribing to your channel for receiving such incredible content in the future. Subscribe animation plays a vital role in converting your viewers into subscribers.

There are so many platforms on the internet from where you can get Youtube subscribe button animation free, and you can also purchase these subscribe png gifs. But creating your own animated subscribe button can make you stand out from the crowd and make your videos unique and exclusive. Because it enables you to design it the way you want according to your brand, so, let's create your own subscribe animation using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Step-By-Step guide

**Step 1:** To get started,open Filmora X. On your upper left corner, click on the "Sample Colors," select the Green color and drag it to Video Track into the timeline. We are using a Green background to easily remove it using the green screen feature in Filmora to use it in our future projects after exporting it, without creating it again. Adjust the duration of this track according to your requirement. In my case, I am trying to make an animated subscribe button of 5 seconds.![subscribe-button1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button1.png)

**Step 2:** Lock this track by clicking on the lock icon to work on subscribe animation without disturbing the background easily.![subscribe-button2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button2.png)

**Step 3:** Now it's time to design the subscribe png gif. Go to the Sample colors again and drag the red color into the time above the green background.![subscribe-button3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button3.png)

**Step 4:** Double click on the red color in the timeline and adjust its size. Make it look like a subscribe button that is a rectangle and place it at the bottom center of the background. You can put it anywhere you want it to appear in your future videos.![subscribe-button4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button4.png)

**Step 5:** Now, let's add Subscribe text into the button. Go to the Title and select any style that you like. "Basic 6" will work perfectly fine for this purpose. Drag and drop it into the timeline above all tracks.![subscribe-button5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button5.png)

**Step 6:** Double click on the Title on the timeline and edit it with "Subscribe" and place it under the red rectangle and click OK.![subscribe-button6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button6.png)

**Step 7:** We have put a cursor that can click on the animated subscribe button. You can use Google Search to find a transparent cursor. Make sure to save it in png format. Download it and import it into Filmora.![subscribe-button7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button7.png)

**Step 8:** Drag and drop the cursor into the timeline and place it above all the other three tracks to make it prominent. Adjust the size of the cursor place it on the Subscribe button where you want it to appear.![subscribe-button8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button8.png)

**Step 9:** Now, it's time to animate the design using keyframes. First of all, let's animate the red rectangle. Double click on the red color on the timeline. Go to the 'Animation' tab and then click 'Customize.' Move to the 1 second in the timeline and click 'Add.'![subscribe-button9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button9.png)

**Step 10:** Now go back to the beginning in the timeline and adjust the scale to 0%. It will make the rectangle pop up when you play the clip.![subscribe-button10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button10.png)

**Step 11:** Text needs to be animated as well to match it with the rectangle. Double click on the text in the timeline and click 'ADVANCED.'![subscribe-button11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button11.png)

**Step 12:** In this Advance text editor, go to the 'Animation' tab and select any animation that you like. On the timeline under the preview screen, adjusts the dark areas according to the time you set on the rectangle, which was 1 second. We want the text to appear on the screen in 1 second, like the rectangle. Also, adjust the ending time when you want the text to disappear again. We have set it on 4 seconds. Which means it will start to fade after 4 seconds.![subscribe-button12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button12.png)

**Step 13:** Now, to animate the mouse cursor, we will use the same process we used for a rectangle that is key framing. Double click on the cursor track on the timeline and move the time on your timeline to a point when you want the cursor to appear. Now add a key frame by clicking 'Add'.![subscribe-button13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button13.png)

**Step 14:** Now jump back to a point in your timeline, when the cursor will start appearing from outside the screen. Move the cursor outside the screen from where you want it to start moving toward the subscribe animation.![subscribe-button14](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button14.png)

**Step 15:** To animate the click of the cursor, move ahead a little bit into your timeline and scale down the cursor to around 70%. Move it a little further and scale it up to 100%.![subscribe-button15](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button15.png)

**Step 16:** You can add the sound of mouse click to make it more realistic. You can find this sound anywhere on the internet. Download it and import it into Filmora. Now place it into the timeline where it can match the movement of the cursor.![subscribe-button16](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button16.png)

**Step 17:** Now it's time to make this subscribe animation button disappear. Move forward into the time to the end, at around 4 seconds. Double click on the red button in the timeline and add a key frame at its actual scale.![subscribe-button17](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button17.png)

**Step 18:** After that, move further in the timeline to the end and make its scale 0\. It will make it disappear.![subscribe-button18](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button18.png)

**Step 19:** Do the same with the cursor. Double click on the cursor in the time and add a key frame at its actual position.![subscribe-button19](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button19.png)

**Step 20:** Move ahead when you want it to disappear. Move the cursor out of the screen and click 'OK'.![subscribe-button20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button20.png)

**Step 21:** Your Subscribe png gif is ready to be exported and used in your videos. Click on export and choose from various formats and options to choose from while exporting it.![subscribe-button21](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subs-button21.png)
