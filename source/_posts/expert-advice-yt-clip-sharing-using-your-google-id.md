Want to share a private YouTube video? A private video is a video that is posted to YouTube, but only viewable to a select group of people who you choose to share it with. It could be that this is a personal video only intended for friends and family, or it could be that you want to get feedback from people you trust before making it public.

Private YouTube videos can be shared with 50 Google accounts.

## **Part 1: How to Share a Private YouTube Video**

You can make a YouTube video private either within the Creator studio or by choosing the option when you first upload a video.

When you mark a video as private you will be able to send the video out to up to 50 e-mail addresses, names of contacts on Google, or your circles on Google plus. As soon as you add a new contact to the list they will receive an invite link to view the video.

Unlike with an unlisted video, the contacts allowed to view a private video will not be able to share the URL of your video with their own friends and contacts.

## **Part 2: Private Video Limitations on YouTube**

The video cannot be shared again and only the individuals invited can view the video at its URL.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 ![private video limitation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-limitation.gif)

 Contacts that you send the private invite too will have to have a YouTube account and be signed in to it, in order to view your video.

## **Part 3: How to Share Unlisted Videos on YouTube**

Another option that YouTube delivers for privacy is the chance to mark videos as unlisted. Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.

To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.

It may be challenging to capture the attention of your audience if the video openings or PowerPoint presentations contain too much text. Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.

Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?

An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.

Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.

You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.

Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg)

The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.

Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg)

Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can [insert a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.

You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.

## Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora

Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text. Filmora lets you add a video to text in just a few simple steps. You can first make a text video with animation first, and then use the picture in picture feature to add the video to text. Here are the detailed information about how to add a video to text in Filmora.

You should start by creating a new project in Filmora and importing the video you want to add to the text into the project. Click on the Titles tab, and choose the title that matches the visual style of your project.

## Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?

An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.

Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.

You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.

Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg)

The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.

Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.

![Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg)

Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can [insert a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.

You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.
