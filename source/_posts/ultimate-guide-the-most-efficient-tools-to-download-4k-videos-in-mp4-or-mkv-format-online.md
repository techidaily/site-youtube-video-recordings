 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: May 07, 2020 

Still trying **online video downloader** to download videos from Facebook, Dailymotion, Vimeo? [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), a **free video downloader** delivers more efficient way to batch download online videos from over 300 sites, like YouTube, Metacafe, Dailymotion, Vevo, Vimeo, Facebook, Break and many more needless of plugins without formats and resolution limits. Now, you are free to download videos movies in HD/4K of any formats online. It is 100% clean, no virus, no spyware, no add on, no spam.

**\[Warning\] YouTube music & copyright-protected contents are not supported for download.**

I see tons of questions like best tool to download online videos, how to download videos online etc. on Yahoo Answers but there's no practical solution. I did a lot of researches, trying dozens of online video downloaders, and I will guide you to how to choose a high-quality [online video grabber](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/), and recommend five-star yet free programs to capture video from any website based on my own experience as wel as users' feedback. 

When you seek online video downloaders, there are several features to look for - it should be free, easy to use and clean. In consideration of these factors, the following programs are worth trying.

#### **1.Online Video Downloaders - Keepvid.com, Savefrom.net, Video Grabber**

There are two features I love. First, these three online video downloaders are free. The other feature I appreciate is their **ease of use**. You can download videos from up to **50 sites** without spending much time reading user guide. Among the three tools, online Video Grabber allows you to convert downloaded online videos of [MP4 to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/)audio. My only beef with them is that you can be easily misguided to download plugins, add on, spyware, adware, and the likes. 

My suggestions: pay more attention to all those well-marked "Download" button(in fact, most of them are for plugins download), choose to download SD videos for HD videos download normally requires you to download third party tool, don't click any pop-up ads, and keep your eyes open during the online video download process. 

#### **2.Alternative to Keepvid, Savefrom, Video Grabber-Professional Video Downloader-5KPlayer**

Similarly, 5KPlayer is free and deadly easy to use, no tricks, no need to study training guide. It is designed to perfectly cater for people's habits of [downloading videos by URL](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/), so you just need to copy, paste video URL and click "Download" button. Superior to the above online video savors, this free video downloader, more than a YouTube video downloader online capable of downloading online videos, allows you to download videos from any website in batch, roughly, over **300 sites**, YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook, Yahoo, Metacafe, Vevo, Break, more than you can tell, without resolution and formats limits. Fast speed is a big highlight, this responsive substitute of online video grabber downloads a music video in **a few seconds**. It is **100% clean and safe to use**, no adware, no spam, no spyware, no pop-up ads, no plugins. Below is the detailed guide on online video download.
