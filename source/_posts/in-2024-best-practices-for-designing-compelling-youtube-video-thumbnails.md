## Best Practice From Experiences

Now, since we know the importance of having a custom thumbnail, it is important to know how to make a thumbnail for Youtube look perfect, appealing, and eye-catching at the same time. There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.

7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.

1. #### Show your face

In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?

![comparison-of-showing-face-or-not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png)

1. #### Use Simple Fonts

With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don't use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.

![simple-fonts-recommended](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png)

1. #### Use Phrases, not sentence

If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/), more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.

![piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png)

![use-phrases-not-sentences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg)

1. #### Put every stuff on left side

When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, "Watch Later" and "Add to Queue," located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.

![put-stuff-on-left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg)

1. #### Have a unique and Consistent style

Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style. Following the same style for all your Youtube thumbnails will make your channel look unique and all your videos identical. It will be easy for viewers to identify your videos when they see them. It gives your channel a touch of its unique brand.

![unique-and-consistent-style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unique-and-consistent-style.png)

1. #### Use elements to grab the attention

To make your Youtube thumbnail more appealing to the viewers, add circles and arrows to grab viewers' attention to something very important in the video. It will increase the curiosity in the viewers and make them click your videos to learn more.

![use-elements-to-grab-attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-elements-to-grab-attention.jpg)

1. #### Choose the right tool

This whole process seems to be very hectic and time taking, but do you know, you can do everything on just one software? There is no need to edit a video in a different software then make a thumbnail in another software. With Filmora X, you can perform all these tasks on a single platform with so many amazing features. Whether you want to remove the background of your image or add attractive titles to it, Filmora X has got you covered.

1. #### Avoid clickbait and irrelevant pics and title

It is one of the old tricks that **so many people on Youtube us**e. **It undoubtedly** brings you clicks and more views, but once the viewer realizes that you have used irrelevant pictures or texts to attract them**. I**n reality, your video doesn't contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don't use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term. Only use the text and images that are relevant to your content and stick to that.

1. #### Choose your preview window wisely

Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don't click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That's why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.

## Best Practice From Experiences

Now, since we know the importance of having a custom thumbnail, it is important to know how to make a thumbnail for Youtube look perfect, appealing, and eye-catching at the same time. There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.

7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.

1. #### Show your face

In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?

![comparison-of-showing-face-or-not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png)

1. #### Use Simple Fonts

With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don't use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.

![simple-fonts-recommended](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png)

1. #### Use Phrases, not sentence

If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/), more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.

![piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png)

![use-phrases-not-sentences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg)

1. #### Put every stuff on left side

When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, "Watch Later" and "Add to Queue," located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.

![put-stuff-on-left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg)

1. #### Have a unique and Consistent style

Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style. Following the same style for all your Youtube thumbnails will make your channel look unique and all your videos identical. It will be easy for viewers to identify your videos when they see them. It gives your channel a touch of its unique brand.

![unique-and-consistent-style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unique-and-consistent-style.png)

1. #### Use elements to grab the attention

To make your Youtube thumbnail more appealing to the viewers, add circles and arrows to grab viewers' attention to something very important in the video. It will increase the curiosity in the viewers and make them click your videos to learn more.

![use-elements-to-grab-attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-elements-to-grab-attention.jpg)

1. #### Choose the right tool

This whole process seems to be very hectic and time taking, but do you know, you can do everything on just one software? There is no need to edit a video in a different software then make a thumbnail in another software. With Filmora X, you can perform all these tasks on a single platform with so many amazing features. Whether you want to remove the background of your image or add attractive titles to it, Filmora X has got you covered.

1. #### Avoid clickbait and irrelevant pics and title

It is one of the old tricks that **so many people on Youtube us**e. **It undoubtedly** brings you clicks and more views, but once the viewer realizes that you have used irrelevant pictures or texts to attract them**. I**n reality, your video doesn't contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don't use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term. Only use the text and images that are relevant to your content and stick to that.

1. #### Choose your preview window wisely

Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don't click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That's why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.

## Part 2: How to Change Video Speed with Keyboard Shortcuts on YouTube

If you are watching a YouTube Video on your computer and want to adjust the playback speed, you can change the speed with keyboard shortcuts.

Here's another way to adjust the **playback speed of YouTube** videos more quickly.

To **fast-forward the YouTube** video, press your shift button and hold down, then tap your greater than(>) symbol on your keyboard. Your **YouTube playback speed** will increase by 0.25 as you keep tapping.

To reduce the **playback speed YouTube** videos, the reverse is the case. Press and hold down the shift tab, then tap less than the (<) symbol.

Changing the playback speed using these keyboard shortcuts increases by 0.25 increments. You have to use custom if you want other values, as earlier mentioned.

## Part 3: How to Change YouTube's Video Playback Speed on Mobile

If you'd like to know **how to speed up YouTube videos** on your Android, iPhone, or iPad, here's it.

First, you must open your YouTube App on your device and play the video you want to watch.

Then tap the video once, and it will bring up the toolbar.

At the top right corner, select the vertically aligned three dots. This will bring out a menu for you—select playback speed.

![youtube playback speed option mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-playback-speed-option-mobile.jpg)

Then you will see a list containing the preset speed provided by YouTube.

![change youtube video speed mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-video-speed-mobile.jpg)

1 is the average speed. Any value below than 1 will slow down the video, while any value above it will increase it.

Once done, close the menu, and the video will resume from where it stopped.

## Part 4: How YouTube's Playback Speed Controls Work?

YouTube has an added feature known as 'playback speed.' This feature allows you to select a speed from 0.25x to 2x the normal speed. With this **YouTube's speed control**, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1/4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.

However, in as much as **YouTube speed control** slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.

Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.

If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can **fast forward YouTube** video by using the feature.

Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this **YouTube speed control**.

**Conclusion**

**YouTube speed control** has made it easier to change **YouTube playback speed** to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.
