It's how you can get discovered by people looking for content exactly like what you offer. Basically, your channel description is like an ad. It tells other users why they should subscribe to your channel.

## Tips for Creating an Amazing YouTube Description

YouTube is not only telling people that they should watch your content. It also tells YouTube to recommend the video to users searching for something to watch. YouTube crawls the description to rank your videos in search results. That said, you must do it right. Here are some tips you should keep in mind.

1. Include the most important keywords in your video description.
2. Inform viewers what to expect from the video. What is it about? Is it a travel blog, food review, or what?
3. Add relevant hashtags to your video description.
4. Add links (relevant resources, your socials, timestamps, links to your other videos, etc.)
5. Ensure the hook is attention-grabbing. Otherwise, people would ignore it and your video altogether.
6. Add a call-to-action to remind your viewers to like and subscribe.
7. Note that only the first 200 characters will appear on the screen. Users need to click the "Show More" button to view the rest. So put what's most important in the first 200 characters.

### Benefits of Using a YouTube Description Templates

Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.
