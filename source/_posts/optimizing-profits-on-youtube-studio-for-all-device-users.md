### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

![android monetization options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-11.jpg)

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

![android comment filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-9.jpg)

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

![android monetization options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-11.jpg)

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

Want to share a private YouTube video? A private video is a video that is posted to YouTube, but only viewable to a select group of people who you choose to share it with. It could be that this is a personal video only intended for friends and family, or it could be that you want to get feedback from people you trust before making it public.

Private YouTube videos can be shared with 50 Google accounts.

## **Part 1: How to Share a Private YouTube Video**

You can make a YouTube video private either within the Creator studio or by choosing the option when you first upload a video.

When you mark a video as private you will be able to send the video out to up to 50 e-mail addresses, names of contacts on Google, or your circles on Google plus. As soon as you add a new contact to the list they will receive an invite link to view the video.

Unlike with an unlisted video, the contacts allowed to view a private video will not be able to share the URL of your video with their own friends and contacts.

## **Part 2: Private Video Limitations on YouTube**

The video cannot be shared again and only the individuals invited can view the video at its URL.

 ![private video limitation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-limitation.gif)

 Contacts that you send the private invite too will have to have a YouTube account and be signed in to it, in order to view your video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Part 3: How to Share Unlisted Videos on YouTube**

Another option that YouTube delivers for privacy is the chance to mark videos as unlisted. Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.

To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.

Want to share a private YouTube video? A private video is a video that is posted to YouTube, but only viewable to a select group of people who you choose to share it with. It could be that this is a personal video only intended for friends and family, or it could be that you want to get feedback from people you trust before making it public.

Private YouTube videos can be shared with 50 Google accounts.

## **Part 1: How to Share a Private YouTube Video**

You can make a YouTube video private either within the Creator studio or by choosing the option when you first upload a video.

When you mark a video as private you will be able to send the video out to up to 50 e-mail addresses, names of contacts on Google, or your circles on Google plus. As soon as you add a new contact to the list they will receive an invite link to view the video.

Unlike with an unlisted video, the contacts allowed to view a private video will not be able to share the URL of your video with their own friends and contacts.

## **Part 2: Private Video Limitations on YouTube**

The video cannot be shared again and only the individuals invited can view the video at its URL.

 Contacts that you send the private invite too will have to have a YouTube account and be signed in to it, in order to view your video.

## **Part 3: How to Share Unlisted Videos on YouTube**

Another option that YouTube delivers for privacy is the chance to mark videos as unlisted. Unlisted videos will not be included in any of the Google search engine results and only individuals that have the link will be able to view the videos on YouTube. A person does not have to have a Google account or any type of password to see unlisted videos, only the link, which means the people you share the video with will also be able to share it with whoever they like.

To share an unlisted video, simply send its URL to anyone you want to watch it. This is easier than sharing private YouTube videos, but not quite as private.
