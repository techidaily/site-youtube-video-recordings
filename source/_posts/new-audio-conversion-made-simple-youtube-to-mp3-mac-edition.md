A YouTube MP3 converter for Mac lets you do those things quickly and easily, without any special computer knowledge.

* [Part1\. Desktop Softwares for Mac to Convert YouTube Videos into MP3s](#Part1)
* [](#part2.)[Part 2\. Online YouTube MP3 Converters for Mac](#Part2)

## Part1. Desktop Softwares for Mac to Convert YouTube Videos into MP3s

Just like the online applications, there are many programs to choose from that allow you to convert YouTube videos to MP3s for Mac. We'll take a closer look at one free option that is great if your needs are limited, and one pay program with complete and superior performance. These are the best recommended YouTube to MP3 converters for Apple Mac OS X:

### Youtube Converter 1: MediaHuman's Free YouTube to MP3 Converter

[MediaHuman's Free YouTube to MP3 Converter](http://www.mediahuman.com/youtube-to-mp3-converter/) offers fast conversions with superior fidelity, for exceptionally clear MP3 files. It works well not only with YouTube, but also Vimeo, Soundcloud, Dailymotion and VEVO.

* **Pros**: High quality MP3s, can simultaneously process multiple files, export direct to iTunes, simple tag editor for easy organization, supports nearly two dozen languages, Windows, Mac and Linux versions
* **Cons**: Limited editing options, requires paid upgrade to access all features, requires 40 Mb storage space, limited format support

### Youtube Converter 2: Wondershare Filmora for Mac

[Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is an outstanding YouTube MP3 converter for Mac, with a suite of superior features. This program not only allows you to convert videos to MP3 files, it also allows you to edit and add effects, save to a native music library, and more. If you have more sophisticated needs for saving, converting and editing YouTube videos and MP3s, Wondershare Filmora is a great choice. The very affordable price tag is another attraction.

CNET reviewed Wondershare Filmora for Mac (Originally Wondershare Video Editor for Mac) and also praised the program extensively: “Wondershare Video Editor provides all the freedom you need to arrange clips and music with a wealth of available filters and transitions. This is a beautiful and capable piece of software.”

Take a close look at your needs and preferences for performance to make the perfect decision about which is the best YouTube MP3 converter for Mac for you.

## Part 2. Online YouTube MP3 Converters for Mac

There are several online applications that allow you to convert YouTube videos to MP3s. Two of the best are:

### Conversion Method 1: YouTube MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube MP3](https://ytmp3.cc/youtube-to-mp3/) is designed with simplicity in mind: you simply paste the YouTube URL into the field and click the “Convert Video” button and the YouTube MP3 website takes care of the rest. When the conversion is complete, you can download your MP3 file from their servers.

* **Pros**: No account needed, free-to-use, compatible with all devices and formats
* **Cons**: Requires fast and reliable online connection, takes 3-4 minutes per video

### Conversion Method 2: YouTube in MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube in MP3](https://yt1s.com/youtube-to-mp3/en3) is very similar to the above application, although it offers several appealing extra features. Paste in your URL and click, and the program does the work quickly – your download will be ready in seconds. This service works on computers, smartphones and tablets, in a variety of formats.

* **Pros**: No account or sign up necessary, free-to-use, offers low-, standard-, and high-quality output, edit MP3s online prior to download
* **Cons**: Requires a very good online connection, lacks more advanced editing and format features of a YouTube MP3 converter for Mac program
