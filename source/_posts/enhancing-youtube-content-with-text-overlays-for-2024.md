# How To Add Captions to YouTube Videos

By captioning your YouTube videos you help to make them accessible to more potential viewers. Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.

This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.

## How To Turn On Captions on YouTube

In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.

![captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG)

To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.

If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your **Account Settings** and selecting **Playback**. Check the box next to **Always Show Captions**, and then check   **Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition**. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The **Always Show Captions** feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.

If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   **Subtitles/CC** . If the language you want is not there select **Auto-Translate**  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.

## Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps

1\. Go to **Video Manager** in your **Creator Studio** and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.

2\. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose **Subtitles and CC**.

3\. Select **Add New** **Subtitles or CC**.

4\. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.

**Create Subtitles or Closed Captions** will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.

**Upload A File** allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.

**Transcribe and Set Timings** is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.

**Use Automatic Captioning** will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.

**Use Captioning Software or Services** is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.

The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use **Automatic Captioning**. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.

![start vlog and make money](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg)

**Background of vlogs on YouTube**

![background of vlogs on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg)

What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017\. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.

**Why vlogs are loved by people**

Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.

But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

So you've started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren't you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let's look at some common reasons why vloggers aren't making any income and figure out how to get around them.

### Who is my target audience?

![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

### What problems am I solving?

![problem solving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg)

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

### Content quality

With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it's clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube's algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you're looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you'll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.

And to do that, you must try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editing software. Let’s have an overview of WonderShare Filmora 11 and how we can create quality content using it.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let's break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.

### YouTube Ads

![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship

![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

### Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg)

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

### Patreon

![support on patreon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg)

Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

### Sell your service or products

![sell products or services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg)

With over 1 billion monthly active users, there's an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!

## Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

So you've started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren't you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let's look at some common reasons why vloggers aren't making any income and figure out how to get around them.

### Who is my target audience?

![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

### What problems am I solving?

![problem solving](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg)

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

### Content quality

With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it's clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube's algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you're looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you'll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.

And to do that, you must try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editing software. Let’s have an overview of WonderShare Filmora 11 and how we can create quality content using it.

Let’s assume you have created the Vlog content. Now, we want you to understand the methods of how you can earn income with vlogging.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let's break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.

### YouTube Ads

![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship

![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

### Affiliate Marketing

![youtube affiliate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg)

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

### Patreon

![support on patreon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg)

Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

### Sell your service or products

![sell products or services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg)

With over 1 billion monthly active users, there's an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category. As for services, you could also offer tips on improving your life, starting an online business, or even becoming a successful Youtuber!

It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you'll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.
