### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.

### 6\. Invest in crowd-funding

It's not just for startups anymore; you can use crowdfunding to fund content creation on YouTube as well. You can find people to support your work through third-party applications like Patreon in exchange for perks. You can now place sponsor buttons on your YouTube videos, which allows you to crowdfund. With this, you can offer rewards in exchange for monthly funding like with Patreon.

### 7\. Stickers, chats, and thanks

During live streams and premieres, creators can engage their fans with Super Chat and Super Stickers. In the live chat, fans can purchase Super Chats to display their message prominently. A Super Sticker is an animated image displayed during a live chat session. The Super Thanks feature enables creators to earn income from their videos. Additional appreciation may be expressed by those who wish to do so

### 8\. YouTube Shorts

Using the YouTube app, short, vertical videos can be uploaded straight to YouTube using a smartphone. In the same way as Instagram Stories are uploaded to the social media site. The length of YouTube shorts is limited to 60 seconds. In 2021 and 2022, a $100 million fund will be distributed for YouTube Shorts. With this initial stage, YouTube Shorts began to monetize in May 2021\. A YouTube Short will only be compensated if it meets the fund's criteria.

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.
