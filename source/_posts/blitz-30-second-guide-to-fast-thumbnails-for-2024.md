To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.

Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn't require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.

---

**Step 01:** To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.

**Step 02:** If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.

**Step 03:** For creating a perfect thumbnail, select "Drone Free Camera" mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.

To grow a Youtube channel, you need to focus on several different factors and elements. Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.

Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn't require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.

---

**Step 01:** To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg)

**Step 02:** If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg)

**Step 03:** For creating a perfect thumbnail, select "Drone Free Camera" mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.

![make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg)

**Step 04:** Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.

**Step 05:** Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.

**Step 06:** Now, let's separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.

![clearing the youtube watch later playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png)

##### Using A Script

Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:

Step1 In the first step, launch the [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/) browser on your system and head to the **YouTube** website**.** Next, select the **"Library"** option in the left pane and click **"Watch Later"** from the menu.

Step2 Now, hit the **"Ctrl + Shift + J"** keys on Windows or the **"Command + Option+ J"** buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.

![using script to clear watch later](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png)

Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.

setInterval(function () { document.querySelector('#primary button\[aria-label="Action menu"\]').click(); var things = document.evaluate( '//span\[contains(text(),"Remove from")\]', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED\_NODE\_SNAPSHOT\_TYPE, null ); for (var i = 0; i < things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);

Step4 In the last step, hit the **"Enter"** key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.

Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.

You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.
