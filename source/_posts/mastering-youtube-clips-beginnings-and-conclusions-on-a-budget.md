## Part1: Intros

#### Elements of an Intro

Intros should only last about five seconds, and that can be cut down to two or three if you have a larger following.

When your intro video is longer than five seconds viewers are more likely to click away. The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.

Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.

#### [Top Intro Sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo. Here are two of the best:

**FlixPress.com**

This is probably the most popular intro site. There are a lot of great animated intros available for under $5, or even for free.

**IntroMaker.net**

This is another site with really professional looking intros for $5\. They only have two free options, though.

#### Creating an Intro in Filmora

You can create a simple intro card in **Filmora**.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

1. Choose your background. You may want to use a short clip as your intro, or you may just want a colored background.
2. Drag your clip or background into the video track of your timeline and trim it down to five seconds.
3. If you have a logo, import it into Filmora and drag it into your picture-in-picture track.
4. With your logo selected, click on the Green Screen icon. In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.
5. Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.
6. Go to the Text/Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.
7. The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.
8. Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.

## Part 2: End Cards

When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.

To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.

#### Elements of an End Card

An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.

It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.

You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.

Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.

#### [How To Make an End Card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

1. Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.
2. Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.
3. Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks. Each clip should be on its track.
4. Trim the clips in your picture in picture track down to the same length as your end card.
5. Shrink your clips down to thumbnail-size by dragging their corners in the preview window.
6. Position your clips so they are spaced evenly by dragging them in the preview screen.
7. Mute your clips.
8. If your background does not include any calls to action, choose a title from the **Text/Titles** menu in Filmora and create at least two – one asking viewers to subscribe, and one asking them to watch your suggested videos.
9. Export your video from Filmora and upload it to YouTube.
10. Go to your **Video Manager** and select **Annotations** in the drop-down menu next to your video.
11. Go to your end card in the previewer, as that is where you want to add your annotations.
12. Click **Add Annotation** and add a spotlight annotation to your video. Stretch it over one of your thumbnails and then check the Link box under your Annotation’s timing. Insert a link to the video you are previewing.
13. Repeat for any other thumbnails. For your subscribe button, change where it said ‘Video’ to ‘Subscribe’ and enter your channel URL.
14. Click **Apply Changes**.

If you're a music producer, you'll probably want to do this as well. However, understanding how to upload music to YouTube might be difficult, so this article is created to assist you.

When you upload a song to YouTube, it becomes available to the entire globe. Unlike other streaming services, anyone can use YouTube for free. This is a one-of-a-kind platform for sharing music. This is an opportunity that every artist should take advantage of, with a potential audience of billions.

So, how do you go about uploading songs to YouTube? Regular file formats aren't applicable; therefore, this is the only challenging component. YouTube does not recognize.mp3 or.mp4 files, which makes things a little more difficult for the average producer. It's simple to get around this.

02 [Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?](#part2)

03 [How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?](#part3)

## Details On Youtube Music

YouTube recently added 'YouTube Music' to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don't have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don't want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube's music.

Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.

Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience's reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don't have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn't have any of these problems.

YouTube's other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site's potential for musical promotion.

## Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?

YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.

#### Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit

The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube's blog and Google's 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it's a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube's new 2 GB size restriction.

#### What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?

* YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.
* Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.
* Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production's audience.
* Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.

**How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?**

If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you'll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube's music policy comes into play.

## How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?

At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn't commonplace, including a video can't hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you're working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.
