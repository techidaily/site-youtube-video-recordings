Like most online photo editors, Fotojet has three different modes and its Design mode is frequently used as a tool for things like YouTube channel art and video thumbnails. However, Fotojet isn't a free platform, even though the free trial period is available (we include it on this list because the trial period would be enough for a lot of people to get their channel art done). The pricing plans vary from $3.33 per month to $6.99, depending on the plan.

 **\-** Features a large collection of YouTube banner templates.

 **\-** Fast, simple, and easy to use.

 **\-** Some options may not be available during the trial period.

### 6. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/)

Besides being one of the best online photo editors, Fotor is also a very decent design tool that functions well as a YouTube channel art maker. Fotor's banner maker feature lets you choose a preset design and insert new text within seconds, and it also allows you to add multiple layers to your images.

 **\-** Outstanding photo editing capabilities.

 **\-** Functional design.

 **\-** Free, but a Pro version is also available.

### 7 . [Snappa](https://snappa.com/)

Everyone loves beautiful images, but we often don't have the time to create them. Snappa is designed to save you time in each step of the process of creating stunning YouTube channel art. Furthermore, this online tool features thousands of high-resolution images, and it allows you to easily add text or graphics to your designs.

### 8. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/home/)

Turning your ideas into compelling visual stories is easy with Adobe Spark because it provides all the graphic design tools you'll ever need to create art for your YouTube channel. With more than 50.000 royalty-free photos, 3500 templates, and over 200 fonts Adobe Spark seems to be the ultimate tool for designing YouTube banners, thumbnails, and even pictures you feature in your videos.

### 9. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

PicMonkey was once a free online design tool but now you’ll have to pay for it. You’re definitely getting a lot more with this paid online design tool. Unlike most of the online design tools that we have previously mentioned, in PicMonkey, you can toggle between layers like you can in PhotoShop, select from a variety of blending options, and you also have the ability to draw and erase. In this entire list, it’s the closest tool you’ll get to PhotoShop.

### 10. [Adobe PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

Last and definitely not the least on our list is Adobe PhotoShop, professional design software that you will have to install onto your computer. You can design your own channel art from scratch or customize pre-made templates to fit your brand.

Do you have a free YouTube channel art maker to recommend?
