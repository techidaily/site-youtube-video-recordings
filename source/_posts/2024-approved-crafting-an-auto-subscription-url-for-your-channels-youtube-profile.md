## Bonus: Will YouTube auto-subscribe me to a new channel?

It is not necessarily true that YouTube auto-subscribe will subscribe to a new channel. However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.

• Spinoff Channel  
A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.

• Check your extensions  
One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser's settings and make the "Unsubscribe" option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.

• Someone else can hit the button  
Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the "Subscribe" button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.

## Conclusion

● The internet arena is very competitive. It would be best if you did everything right to drive as many YouTube auto-subscribers as possible to your channel.

Suppose you are interested in preserving the identity of people in your YouTube videos, or you are simply interested in luring out some of the faces of the objects in your YouTube videos to retain filming rights. In that case, you can do it quite easily. With the help of a proper editing application and some online tools, you can very quickly blur out faces or objects from your YouTube videos.

* [Part 1: With the best YouTube video editing software](#part1)
* [Part 2: With YouTube Video Editor](#part2)

### Blur Faces With the Best YouTube Video Editing Software

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best video editing tools for YouTube videos. Through the Filmora editing suite, you can quickly import the video and then go to the power town to blur out faces, distort objects, and more.

* You first need to download and install Wondershare Filmora
* Then it is time to load the video you wish to edit
* You can either browse the tape from your computer or drag and drop it
* Once loading is finished, you can drag and drop the video to the Video Timeline
* Afterward, you must target the exact video on the timeline
* Right-click and choose the Power Tool available
* A pop-up window will appear, where you must choose Face-Off and then Apply Face Off to the Clip
* The effect you want is the first option you get, or else the mosaic
* By clicking on the mosaic, it will be applied to your video
* Click OK
* Now you must choose Export to save the video
* Please choose the right format and the save option of your choosing (instant post on YouTube, burn the video on CD/DVD or save it on your PC)

If you are recording your tutorial for YouTube or your demonstration videos, you may need to blur or hide the private and sensitive information. Click [to check how did I hide the personal info in the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
