 **No. 4 Most Popular 2016 Scary Movie with Ghost - The Conjuring 2**

Scary movie of haunted house type is nothing unfarmiliar, but not a single movie of this type can surpass James Wan's authentic horror level, at leat for now. After directing **Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring 1**, Fast and Furious 4, James Wan's skill in seizing audiances' fear, timing, plotting, rendering horror atmosphere and storing up for a climax is proved to be unparalleled.  
The Conjuring 2 is a must watch horror scary movie 2016! 

![Lights Out Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-2.jpg)

**No. 5 Best Horror Movie 2016 Directed by "Ponysmasher" - Lights Out** 

Another 2016 horror movie hit from producer James Wan. Only this time it was directed by David Sandberg who is renowned for [his short horror films](https://www.youtube.com/user/ponysmasher/videos) like Coffer, See You Soon, Pictured, Cam Closer, Attic Pnic, Closet Space, and will also helm the upcoming **2018 Annabelle 2** and **Lights Out 2**. Based on 2013 [David Sandberg's horror short of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fDzdDfviLI), Lights Out will let you fall in the scare for darkness again but this time, it's not the mirror (in Conjuring 2) that will do the trick but the flickering of the light. Through the connection of their mom, an evil spirit is coming to slaughter. (5KPlayer helps you free download all shortfilms of "Ponysmasher".)

![Don't Breathe Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-3.png)

**No. 6 Best Horror Movie 2016 Home Invasion Thriller - Don't Breathe**

Breaking into others' house for a perfect stealing seems not so easy this time when the house is owned by a tough blind man who's got armed with sensitive ears, smartness and guns. Getting trapped in their own digging and accidentaly revealing a more severe crime in the basement, those teens will not be easily set free. Right amount of tense, nerve-wracking plot, this horror movie 2016 can give you a break from those jump-scares supernatural scary movies.

![Hush Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-4.jpg) 

 **No. 7 Best 2016 Scary Movie A Modern Slasher - Hush**

Another home-invasion horror movie 2016 that can stir quite a big scare. The same director of **Oculus, Ouija: Origin of Evil** and **Before I Wake**, Mike Flanagan has made his knack for horror movie of both slasher and supernatural. Very impressive another work done with Hush. This is one of those great horror movies on Netflix streaming! Also, if you are a fan of Jacob Tremblay (Room, before i wake) and Charlie Heaton then the comming **horror film 2018 Shut In** shall not be missed!

![Rings Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-5.jpg) 

 **No. 8 Best Big Name Supernatural Horror Movie Series Return - Rings (2018)**

Another big name supernatural horror film returns - the Ring series, only that this chapter is named Rings rather than prequels The Ring and The Ring 2 and it combines supernatural with body horror - vomiting hair, molting, bleeding inside - all suggesting that Samara wants a rebirth rather than just revenge in the videotape. However, this horror film is rescheduled to 2018 rivaling **the Bye Bye Man**.

![The Witch Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-6.jpg)

 **No. 9 Best Supernatural Religious Horror Movie 2016 - The Witch**

"Disturbing and nerve-wracking slow burn whose profoundly anguishing atmosphere made my skin crawl and left me almost crying in panic." This horror movie 2016 is quite different from those jump scares. It elevates to religious belief, seduction, mistrust, repression of sexual desire. You can see how the devil brutely and slowly unravels a devoted Christian family. The little brother's dying scene really reminded me of Bernini's sculpture of Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, bearing the pain and love at the same time. 

![Goodnight Mommy Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-7.jpg) 

**No. 10 Psycho Art Horror Movie 2015 - Goodnight Mommy**

Perfect for extreme horror enthusiasts who are not in a rush for incessant jump scares, since the climax would be slowly reached at the end of the movie. This Austrian super horror film tells a dark story of a young boy maltreating and killing his own mom and himself due to child schizophrenia and lack of family care. One of the best foreign films of 2015 almost being nominated by the 88th Acadmey Award, yet a bit cliche and predictable.

![The Babadook Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-8.jpg)

 **No. 11 Another Must Watch Psychological Horror Movie 2014 - The Babadook**

This psychological horror movie 2012 is really a genuine horror more haunting than Conjuring and Sinister. Trapped in their own nightmare, the mom tries to overcome her boy's behavioral issues and her memories with the car accident losing her husband. The movie is more about living struggles than dealing with the whole supernatural threat. They're being tormented by life.

![Insidious Movie Poster](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/horror-movie-9.jpg) 

 **No. 12 Creepiest Horror Movie 2013 2010 2018 - Insidious Chapter 1/2/The Last Key** 

If you are a fan of The Exorcist 1973 and Conjuring supernatural horror, then Insidious is the right place to get your nerves again. A haunted family tried to get rid of the evil spirits, finding and protecting their son and find back their real dad. Insidious Chapter 1 and 2 are decent with gripping storyline (they put a lot effort on plot design, bravo job!) while Insidious Chapter 3 is less qualified. Also, **Insidious: The Last Key** will be on screen in Jan 2018\. By viewing its trailer, the intense horror might be back on track!

 **No. 13 Best Horror Movie 2012 Scary Maze Game - Sinister** 

Like Conjuring, this movie has a fair share of jump scares as well as 'Saw' level disturbing scenes (well, way lower than SAW). Ellison moves his family into a house where he finds a box of 8 films in the attic. He closely looked into the tapes so as to write a best-selling book, yet only to discover the ghost murders of the previous families who lived in this house dating back to 1966\. Strange things are gradually surfacing and can they escape from the curse? FYI, the ending is kinda like Sia's dance music video, which should have done better; and Sinister 2 is less riveling comparing to Sinister 1.
