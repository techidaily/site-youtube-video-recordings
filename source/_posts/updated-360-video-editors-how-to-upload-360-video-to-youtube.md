#### 3) What are Facebook business accounts and personal accounts?

Facebook business accounts are designed for users who want to use Facebook to administer their pages and advert campaigns. This account cannot be found in searching or receiving friend request apps. Nonetheless, personal accounts are used at basic and casual levels. You can search for friends and send requests. Personal accounts are also easy to manage.

#### 4) Can I mobilize people to share my posted content on Facebook?

Yes, it is possible to let others share what you have posted. Just ensure they know your intention by constant reminders. Some popular ways that are proven to be effective include the use of “Call to Action,” using an image or video with your Facebook status update and offering some incentive to your fans for sharing.

#### 5) Does the quality of my YouTube content drop when I share it with Facebook?

Of course not! What you pull from your YouTube channel is the kind of video that will be watched from Facebook. The quality cannot deteriorate. However, it is good to ensure you compose quality videos on YouTube before sharing them. Several video editing apps like Filmora can help you compose quality videos with high resolution.
