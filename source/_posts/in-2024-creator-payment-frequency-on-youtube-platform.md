### 3\. How Do I Add Songs To The Replay Mix Playlist?

You can't manually add songs to the Replay Mix because YouTube Music automatically adds tracks that you listen to more than once.

The more often you hear a soundtrack, the higher it will appear on the YouTube list. Conversely, songs you've only played once or twice will appear lower on the list.
