## **Part 3\. YouTube Shorts Monetization: A Realistic Look at Earnings Potential**

Monetizing YouTube Shorts has the potential to make decent earnings. Although the amount is not as much as a long-form videos, it is a great way of making money on YouTube quickly. Most YouTube Shorts creators agree that the revenue per thousand views (RPM) for short-form content is currently around $0.05 - $0.07\.

### **Factors** **That Influence Earnings**

The amount of money you make on YouTube Shorts is not fixed. It will depend on several factors, including the revenue channel and your interactions with viewers

* **Ad revenue:** A higher view count on Shorts increases ad revenue from the ads that are between Shorts on the platform.
* **Viewer engagement:** Viewer engagement brings in additional revenue through features like Super Thanks.
* **Number of monetized Shorts:** Monetizing most of your short-form videos will increase the revenue generated.
* **Shopping Revenue:** How well you promote your products and the set price point of the products will determine the shopping revenue generated.
