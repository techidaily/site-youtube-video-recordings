#### 1\. What is the best cooking channel on YouTube?

If you prefer American cuisine, Tasty is gorgeous because of its abundant recipes for making burgers, pizza, and steak. If you are crazy about Sushi or Udon noodle, Cooking with Dog is an amazing channel on YouTube. If you are a cakeholic, you must not miss Rosanna Pansino, who can even bake a Tiger King.

#### 2\. What should I name my YouTube cooking channel?

Here are some ideas of naming your YouTube cooking channel. You can start with “Cook with XXX (your name),” “XXX (your name) in the Kitchen,” or other funny names like Devilish Baker.

#### 3\. How do I start a cooking vlog?

Before starting a cooking vlog, you need to define your brand and get enough equipment. Learn more recipes and practice cooking before shooting.
