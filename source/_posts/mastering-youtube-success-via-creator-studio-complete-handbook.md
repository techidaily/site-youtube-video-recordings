##### Step 3Organize Your Project Material

Manage the files you will be using in the editing project. Creating a folder for the project allows you to organize the file using different criteria such as type or purpose such as food footage.

![organize files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-9.JPG)

##### Step 4Place Files on the Timeline

Time to start editing your video. Place the video and audio files on the timeline while removing the redundant parts. Use the drag-and-drop feature to edit the clips, one at a time, cutting out unneeded footage to have a clear story.
