## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What software do YouTubers use to record gameplay?

Most gamers on YouTube use Open Broadcast System (OBS) and Bandicam to record their gameplays. However, there are a few more authentic screen recording tools for high-quality video recording, such as Filmora.

Using Filmora to record your gameplay will help you save the video in all major video formats. Moreover, the tool is also compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems.

### Q2\. How do I record my screen smoothly?

You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.

Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.

### Q3\. Does screen recording decrease FPS?

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What software do YouTubers use to record gameplay?

Most gamers on YouTube use Open Broadcast System (OBS) and Bandicam to record their gameplays. However, there are a few more authentic screen recording tools for high-quality video recording, such as Filmora.

Using Filmora to record your gameplay will help you save the video in all major video formats. Moreover, the tool is also compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems.

### Q2\. How do I record my screen smoothly?

You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.

Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.

### Q3\. Does screen recording decrease FPS?

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.
