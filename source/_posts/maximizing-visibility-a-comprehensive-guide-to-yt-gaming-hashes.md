### Method 3: Can go with YouTube browser

Hey guys, there is one more trick. Whenever you want to access YouTube, instead of going through the application, try to open YouTube website either from your mobile or PC browser window. You would wonder why so and what difference it will make. The fact is that the Shorts tab has not yet been incorporated under the browser version of YouTube.

So friends, try this to avoid seeing YouTube Shorts videos either from phone or desktop. This is not only simple but also device-free. And even if you do not have a YouTube application, you can use this trick to solve your concern.

### Method 4: Factory reset

If you disagree with the shorts video and want to get off of it entirely. This trick might help you. For this, visit the YouTube app on your mobile and press on it for some time. Doing so will lead you to the info section under the settings.

When you click on the **Uninstall** option, the YouTube version will get downgraded to the factory version. This is the version that is a pre-installed version of YouTube that comes with the device.

Also, if you have not updated your YouTube app, then don’t go with that. However, you will receive notifications many times that you should update your application. Just ignore it, especially if you are not willing to add the Shorts video option on your YouTube application.
