Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of Avidemux is its extreme flexibility. This free video editor is available for Windows, iOS, and Linux, and it supports a wide variety of formats and codecs. It is primarily intended for basic cutting, but in the hands of a capable editor, it can perform very well on more demanding projects. Avidemux is also known for its strong scripting capacities, which allow for faster execution of routine tasks and consequently a more streamlined video production process.

## 2\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

As a public project that involved a large number of creative professionals during the design stage, Blender is truly a promising alternative to corporate products. This free creative suite is quite versatile and can be used for tasks such as game creation, video editing, post-production effects, and rendering.

* Primarily intended for 3D animation projects
* Allows great creative freedom on a wide range of tasks
* Customizable and user-friendly interface

## 3\. [Wondershare Filmii](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* Allows keying for green screen effects
* Support for 3D videos

## 5\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/lae/imovie/)

Available for: iOS, Mac OS

Video makers who prefer Apple hardware will be tempted to use iMovie for video editing purposes, and they certainly won’t go wrong. This free software has all it takes to produce a stunning-quality video, including ten cinematic filters. It is even possible to start editing the shots on your phone, then easily transfer them to your MacBook laptop to execute more precise operations and tweak the colors.

* Works on all Apple devices, including smartphones and iPods
* Supports 4K high-resolution videos
* Amazing filters for cinematic quality of your videos
* Easy sharing to social networks or directly to YouTube

## 6\. [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/)

The timeline is very easy to manage, while users can take advantage of real-time effects and color correction tools to improve the look of the video.

* Support for work on dual monitors
* Frame rate adjustment

## 7\. [Machete Video Editor Lite](http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html)

Available for: Windows

As a simplified version of a more comprehensive professional solution, Machete Lite has obvious advantages over other free video editing software products. It supports only two formats (AVI and WMS), so its range of applications is somewhat limited. On the positive side, most video and audio codecs are supported, while the interface is very intuitive. Overall, it’s a good choice for anyone looking to edit simple videos quickly.

* Support for Ultra HD 4K video
* Ability to merge separate video files in the same format
* Access to metadata (file tags)

## 8\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Linux

A unique combination of simplicity and power sets Open Shot apart from similar products. Basic cutting and composing are surprisingly simple and quick, and more demanding users will discover a trove of advanced features. The program lets you work with unlimited layers so it is possible to add background video or multiple audio channels, while its video effects engine can achieve truly impressive results.

* Easy to learn, easier to use
* Excellent video cutting tools
* Visualization of audio files

## 9\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Linux

## 10\. [VideoPad](http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Android, Kindle

You don’t have to be a professional editor to take full advantage of Video Pad and its advanced features. This free package packs more than 50 amazing video effects and transitions, so it’s super easy to transform your home video into a visual masterpiece. The editor has no issues with any commonly used video format, and it can take direct input from a camcorder or a webcam. Image stabilization and color correction tools complete the package and guarantee great looking videos.

* Video effects that anyone can use with amazing results
* Drag-and-drop commands for simple editing
* Multi-track audio mixing

## 11\. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Available for: Windows

Broad compatibility is one of the greatest strengths of this software, as it supports practically any format or codec you can think of. However, it is also notable for non-linear editing capacities, great visual/audio effects, and the simple creation of masks. With the help of some color blending and a few filters, VSDC can be used to produce smooth, attention-grabbing YouTube videos, as well as a range of other video materials with absolute ease, even if you are new to filmmaking.

* Non-linear sequencing of shots
* Precise object positioning and/or masking
* Simple exporting of finished videos to social networks

## 12\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

Special effects and green screen effects are straightforward to use with an online solution that doesn’t require any downloads or software installation.

* Cloud-based solution with hosted storage
* Intuitive interface that allows easy access to all features
* Support for high-resolution 4K video files

## 13\. Windows Movie Maker

Available for: Windows

Everyone knows about this editor since it’s been around for a long time. Microsoft stopped releasing new versions, but Windows Movie Maker remains relevant in 2018\. It’s definitely not the most advanced product in the market and it is best suited for simple projects and beginner-level users. However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.

* Already included on many Windows-based computers
* Sourcing footage from a computer or camera
* Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks

## Are you ready for something better?

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As you can see, there is no shortage of free video editing software suites. However, free software does tend to be either very limited, or very specifically targeted (i.e. Blender is specifically for animators). Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.

What free video editing software have you tried?

Wondershare's [**Filmora** **Video Editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great choice for YouTubers and other video creators who are starting to grow out of programs like Windows Movie maker. You can even try all the features for free, for as long as you like! Exports from the free trial do have a watermark, though.

## 3\. [Wondershare Filmii](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This free software has all it takes to produce a stunning-quality video, including ten cinematic filters.

## 7\. [Machete Video Editor Lite](http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html)

Available for: Windows

As a simplified version of a more comprehensive professional solution, Machete Lite has obvious advantages over other free video editing software products. It supports only two formats (AVI and WMS), so its range of applications is somewhat limited. On the positive side, most video and audio codecs are supported, while the interface is very intuitive. Overall, it’s a good choice for anyone looking to edit simple videos quickly.

* Support for Ultra HD 4K video
* Ability to merge separate video files in the same format
* Access to metadata (file tags)

## 8\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

* Excellent video cutting tools
* Visualization of audio files

## 9\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Available for: Windows, Mac OS, Linux

This free package packs more than 50 amazing video effects and transitions, so it’s super easy to transform your home video into a visual masterpiece. The editor has no issues with any commonly used video format, and it can take direct input from a camcorder or a webcam. Image stabilization and color correction tools complete the package and guarantee great looking videos.

* Video effects that anyone can use with amazing results
* Drag-and-drop commands for simple editing
* Multi-track audio mixing

## 11\. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Available for: Windows

Broad compatibility is one of the greatest strengths of this software, as it supports practically any format or codec you can think of. However, it is also notable for non-linear editing capacities, great visual/audio effects, and the simple creation of masks. With the help of some color blending and a few filters, VSDC can be used to produce smooth, attention-grabbing YouTube videos, as well as a range of other video materials with absolute ease, even if you are new to filmmaking.

* Non-linear sequencing of shots

* Intuitive interface that allows easy access to all features
* Support for high-resolution 4K video files

## 13\. Windows Movie Maker

Available for: Windows

Everyone knows about this editor since it’s been around for a long time. Microsoft stopped releasing new versions, but Windows Movie Maker remains relevant in 2018\. It’s definitely not the most advanced product in the market and it is best suited for simple projects and beginner-level users. However, its cutting and editing tools are pretty solid, while transitions, animations, and visual effects are quite simple to pull off.

* Already included on many Windows-based computers
* Sourcing footage from a computer or camera
* Direct sharing to YouTube and other networks

## Channel-Saving Techniques: YouTube Meets IGTV

Publishing video content on social media platforms like Instagram or IGTV can help influencers and brands reach new customers. The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise **video upload requirements**, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be **saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio**.

YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to **upload a YouTube video to IGTV** and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.

* [Part 2: Use YouTube to IGTV Online Converter](#part2)
* [Part 3: Convert YouTube Video to IGTV with FXP](#part3)

## Part 1: Convert YouTube Videos to IGTV Vertical Videos with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you don’t already have the original file of the video you’d like to upload to your IGTV channel, you can [download a video from YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but keep in mind that you can’t use any content without permission from its owner.

Once you have the file, you can **create a new project** in Filmora and then after the project loads you should click on the **File menu** and select the **Project Settings option**. Pick one of the **9:16** video resolution options provided by the editor and click **OK to confirm the changes**.

![Filmora  Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-project-settings-window.jpg)

Click on the **Import button** to add a YouTube video to your project and then place it on the timeline. Your video will be displayed in the **Preview Panel**, and you’ll be able to see that the video is positioned at the center of the panel and that its top and bottom are black.

Go to the **Effects tab** and click on the **Background Blur** submenu if you want to blur the empty areas of the frame. Add the **Basic Blur effect** to the timeline and drag one of its sides to position it over the entire video.

![Filmora  convert YouTube to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-convert-youtube-video-igtv.jpg)

In case you are working with a video that already has a 16:9 aspect ratio, you can create a project that has the same aspect ratio, and then just use **the Rotate slider in the Transform menu**, to change turn a landscape video into a portrait video. The scaling tool is helpful to enlarge the frames in a vertical aspect ratio.

![Filmora  convert YouTube to IGTV with transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-to-convert-youtube-igtv.jpg)

Filmora lets you create vertical videos in just a few quick steps, which makes it a perfect choice for influencers and marketers who want to share video content on YouTube and IGTV.

Latest News: In Filmora V10.5 and later versions, there is a new feature called Auto-Reframe. This feature allows users to convert one video for different social media platforms based on the aspect ratio changing, and its features of detecting the moving object. Click the Analyze button, and Filmora will convert this 16:9 YouTube video to vertical 9:16 IGTV video automatically. And I can adjust frames to follow Yasmine’s movement to fine-tune the result.

## Part 2: Use Kapwing to Convert YouTube to IGTV Online

YouTubers who already have lots of videos on their channel can use online video editing platforms, like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) to edit the content they want to post on IGTV. This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.

Click on the Resize tool and simply **copy and paste the URL** of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will **automatically import a video and display it on the screen** once the content is finally fetched.

![Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg)

Pick the **Story (Snap/Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option** and then proceed to **choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video**. Click on the **Create button** when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. **All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked** and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.

![Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg)

A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the **Rotate**  option and then rotate it **90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise** and click on the **Create button**. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.

## Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro

Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to **set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio**. During the video editing process, you will have to **resize all of the footage** you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.

If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.

**Conclusion**

Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV? Leave a comment and let us know.

In case you are working with a video that already has a 16:9 aspect ratio, you can create a project that has the same aspect ratio, and then just use **the Rotate slider in the Transform menu**, to change turn a landscape video into a portrait video. The scaling tool is helpful to enlarge the frames in a vertical aspect ratio.

![Filmora  convert YouTube to IGTV with transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-to-convert-youtube-igtv.jpg)

Filmora lets you create vertical videos in just a few quick steps, which makes it a perfect choice for influencers and marketers who want to share video content on YouTube and IGTV.

Latest News: In Filmora V10.5 and later versions, there is a new feature called Auto-Reframe. This feature allows users to convert one video for different social media platforms based on the aspect ratio changing, and its features of detecting the moving object. Click the Analyze button, and Filmora will convert this 16:9 YouTube video to vertical 9:16 IGTV video automatically. And I can adjust frames to follow Yasmine’s movement to fine-tune the result.

## Part 2: Use Kapwing to Convert YouTube to IGTV Online

YouTubers who already have lots of videos on their channel can use online video editing platforms, like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) to edit the content they want to post on IGTV. This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.

Click on the Resize tool and simply **copy and paste the URL** of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will **automatically import a video and display it on the screen** once the content is finally fetched.

![Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg)

Pick the **Story (Snap/Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option** and then proceed to **choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video**. Click on the **Create button** when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. **All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked** and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.

![Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg)

A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the **Rotate**  option and then rotate it **90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise** and click on the **Create button**. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.

## Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro

Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to **set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio**. During the video editing process, you will have to **resize all of the footage** you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.

If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.

**Conclusion**

Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV? Leave a comment and let us know.

Publishing video content on social media platforms like Instagram or IGTV can help influencers and brands reach new customers. The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise **video upload requirements**, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be **saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio**.

YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to **upload a YouTube video to IGTV** and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.
