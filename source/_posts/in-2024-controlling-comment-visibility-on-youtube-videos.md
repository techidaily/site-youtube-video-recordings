• It has fast rendering sped for your video

• The lifetime price is affordable.

However, there are some disadvantages to the usage of Filmora X, which are:

• The free version contains the Filmora X watermark

• The color grading tool is limited.

## Blender

If you are looking for software for the model, game creating, and animation then opting for Blender will be a good fit. You can trim videos, insert filters, and add as many videos as you want.

Pros

* The 3D graphics make it suitable for editing YouTube videos.
* Composting system and node-based material
* It supports your Mac.

Cons:

* It could be slow when running
* Some think it might be a bit complicated.

Although there is other editing software for your Mac, [Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) simplifies the whole process. If you are looking for quality wrapped in affordability and convenience, then Filmora X will be right for you. Start editing and enjoy the ride!
