The American vlogger started her YouTube channel that currently has over 15 million subscribers in 2009\.

#### 2.[Zoe Elizabeth Sugg](https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390)

Zoe is better known for her online pseudonym Zoella. She started her career as a blogger in 2009\. By the end of the same year, her blog had thousands of followers, which gave Zoe the idea to start her own YouTube channel. A little less than a decade later Zoella channel has 12 million subscribers and it is widely considered as one of the highest beauty and fashion authorities on the Internet.

Besides producing informative and captivating beauty tutorials, she also frequently uploads videos about food, lifestyle, fashion, and traveling. However, her skincare and makeup product reviews are what Zoe is famous for.

Today this 23-year old Philadelphian focuses on DIY beauty tutorials, although videos on her channel often cover a range of different topics.

Levin started her career with a video titled 'How to Conceal Under Eye Circles' in 2010 and in the next few years her YouTube channel was one of the fastest-growing channels in the world. Rachel's most viewed videos combine humor with beauty and fashion which makes them a joy to watch.

#### 4. [Nikkie De Jager](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzTKskwIc%5F-a0cGvCXA848Q)

#### 5. [Eva Gutowski](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva)

The MyLifeAsEva YouTube channel was started by Gutowski in 2011 and for the last seven years, it has steadily grown more popular. In June 2018 Eva's channel had 8.6 million subscribers and her unique beauty videos frequently attract millions of viewers.

Marzia designs clothes and shoes that can be purchased at her online store.

Besides being one of the most influential beauty gurus on YouTube Jeffrey Steininger is also a songwriter, singer, fashion designer, and model. He first rose to prominence by publishing music on his MySpace page, which soon resulted in his first solo album 'Beauty Killer'.

His style may be unorthodox since it resonates better within a younger, more open-minded audience, but the makeup tips he provides in his videos can be used by anyone to get the look they always wanted. Jeffree Star's YouTube channel has 7.4 million subscribers which shows just how popular this Californian really is. Jeffry also has his own fashion and cosmetics line.

#### 8. [Carli Bybel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CarliBel55)

#### 9. [Mindy McKnight](https://www.youtube.com/user/CuteGirlsHairstyles)

A great idea for a new haircut is hard to come by, which is one of the reasons why Mindy's Cute Girls Hairstyles channel is so popular. The idea to create hairstyle videos came in the early 2000s, but it wasn't until 2008 that Mindy realized she wanted to produce vlogs. She has been posting videos to YouTube since 2009, and she currently has 5.5 million subscribers.

Her videos offer quick and creative hairstyle solutions that will make any women look amazing. Mindy's twin daughters, Brooklyn and Baily have their own YouTube channel with a substantial amount of subscribers.

#### 10. [Promise Phan](https://www.youtube.com/user/dope2111)

Since 2009, Promise has run her incredibly popular dope2111 YouTube channel that has over 5 million subscribers. Her makeup transformation techniques which she presents in the videos posted on her channel have stunned the world. Promise has disguised herself as Johnny Depp, Scarlett Johansson, Michael Jackson, or Angelina Jolie to mention just a few celebrities she covered.
