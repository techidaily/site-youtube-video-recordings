<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

### Method 1: Using YouTube Video’s URL

Because every YouTube video has a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that is unique for that particular clip, PowerPoint allows you to use it to embed the footage to any of its slides. The process is simple, and you can follow the steps given below to get this done:

**Step 1: Copy the URL**

Open your default web browser, go to the YouTube video you want to embed to PowerPoint, and copy its URL from the address bar at the top.

**Step 2: Add URL to PowerPoint**

![ embed YouTube video to PowerPoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/embed-youtube-video-via-url.jpg)

Launch PowerPoint if it is not already open, go to the slide you want to embed the YouTube video to, click **Insert** from menu bar present above the Ribbon, click **Video** from the **Media** section at the right end of the Ribbon, click **Online Video** from the list that appears, in the **Enter the URL for the online video** field on the **Online Video** box, paste the URL that you copied earlier, and click **Insert** to **insert YouTube video into PowerPoint**.

**Step 3: Position the Player**

Once the video is added to the PowerPoint slide, drag its frame and reposition it to a suitable location.

### Method 2: Embed a YouTube Video with Embed Code (For Microsoft PowerPoint 2016)

Unlike PowerPoint 2019 that accepts URLs and embed codes in a single URL field, MS PowerPoint 2016 lets you choose how you want to insert a video. The step-by-step instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Step 1: Obtain Embed Code**

Go to the YouTube video you want to embed to your PowerPoint slide, click the **SHARE** icon from the left area under the video player, click the **Embed** icon in the **Share** box, and click **COPY** from the bottom-right corner of the **Embed Video** box that appears next.

![ embed YouTube video code to PowerPoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/embed-youtube-video-in-powerpoint-via-embed-code.jpg)

**Step 2: Get to the PowerPoint’s Insert Video Box**

Launch MS PowerPoint 2016, click **Insert** from the menu bar at the top, from the **Media** section in the right of the Ribbon, click **Video**, and then click **Online Video** to open the **Insert Video** box.

**Step 3: Embed the Video**

Paste the embed code you copied earlier in the **Paste embed code here** field present next to the **From a Video Embed Code** option, and press **Enter** to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint**.

### Method 3: Insert YouTube Video into PowerPoint by Searching Names (For Microsoft PowerPoint 2016)

Microsoft Office 2016 has another lucrative feature that allows users to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint** by searching its name. You can follow the steps given below to find the videos published on YouTube, and insert them to your presentation:

**Step 1: Get to the Insert Video Box**

Use the process explained in **Step 2** of **Method 2** to get to the **Insert Video** box after selecting the slide you want to add a video to.

**Step 2: Search and Embed a Video**

In the **Search YouTube** field next to the **YouTube** option, type the name of the video you want to search on YouTube, press **Enter**, select the video you want to embed, and click **Insert** to **insert YouTube video into PowerPoint**.

### Method 4: Insert Video from PC

Another method to **embed YouTube video in PowerPoint** is by downloading the clip to your PC, and then inserting the footage from there. You can use any free YouTube downloader to obtain a video that is available on YouTube.

Once the file is on your computer, the following steps explain how it can be embedded to your PowerPoint slide:

**WARNING:** YouTube videos may be subject to copyright. Therefore, before downloading and embedding a video to your PowerPoint slide, make sure that you have proper rights to do so, or that the video can be used for the purpose without any written permission from its creator.

**Step 1: Get to the Insert Ribbon**

Open PowerPoint and select the slide you want to embed a YouTube video to. Go to **Insert** from the menu bar at the top.

**Step 2: Insert the Video**

Click the **Video** icon from the **Media** section of the Ribbon, click **Video on My PC** from the list, and use the **Insert Video** box that appears to select and insert the video to your PowerPoint slide.

**Step 3: Resize and/or Modify the Video**

Grab any of the six handles of the video you inserted, and drag it inward to decrease the size of the frame. It is advisable to use the corner handle and drag them diagonally to maintain proper aspect ratio of the player’s frame. Next, right-click anywhere inside the frame, click **Format Video** from the context menu, and use the options that appear in the right pane to make necessary adjustments to the clip like color correction, manage brightness and contrast, etc.
