_Navin explains this issue really clearly._

YouTube announced changes to its Partnership Program for some time. For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.

My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.

_I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those._

However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.

#### 1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number

This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.

Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).

If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.

#### 2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

![ the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg)

_Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight._

How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.

You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.

It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.

#### 3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized

YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.

Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.

#### 4. Thieves won’t profit

There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.

This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.

Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.

YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.

_TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers._

There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?

It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.

This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.

## Could this affect your CPM?

Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.

Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?

## What Is a DJ Template Video Download?

DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.

There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:

* **Pre-Designed Visuals:** These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.
* **Customizable Elements:** You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event's theme.
* **Format and Compatibility:** They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.

## Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?

Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.

With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.

After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.

## How to Customize Templates for a Unique Experience?

The way you customize these templates is by editing them in a video editor of your choice after downloading them. However, not all templates are customizable.

In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.

This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.

You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.

## Technical Considerations

Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.

So, consider the following:

##### 1\. Video Resolution and Quality

Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.

Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.

##### 2\. Format Compatibility

Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.

Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.

##### 3\. Performance and Playback

The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.

If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.

##### 4\. Audio Sync

Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.

You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Legal Aspects and Copyright

This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.

Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:

* **Read the Fine Print**: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.
* **Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use**: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.
* **Attribution Requirements**: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.
* **Modifications and Derivative Works**: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.
