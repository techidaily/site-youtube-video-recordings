But there are legal issues you need to consider before joining the conversion trend. Technically, it is not illegal to convert a YouTube video to MP3 - but it is illegal to download a copyrighted music video. Moreover, YouTube has stated that stream-ripping violates their Terms of Service, and both YouTube & Google have tried to shut down numerous websites that provide video conversion services.

#### 2\. How Can I Save a Song From YouTube to My iPhone?

There are several ways to do that. The legal and recommended method is to get a YouTube Music Premium subscription. This will enable you to download songs from YouTube and save them on your iPhone for offline consumption. The alternative way involves numerous websites and apps that enable you to convert YouTube videos to mp3 and download them on your iPhone. This approach, however, is illegal and should be avoided.
