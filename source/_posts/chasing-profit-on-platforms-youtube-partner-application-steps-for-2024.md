2. When you reach it, click on the three vertical dots at the bottom corner of your comment. You should see an option called Delete. Click on that. You need to confirm once more that you want to delete it, and the process will be complete.

## Delete Other People’s Comments on Others’ Channels

Did you see a hate comment on your favorite creator’s video? Sadly, you cannot delete the comment. But, you can report it, and YouTube will hide or take it down.

You can do this both from your desktop or your phone with some easy steps.

**How to report people’s comments** **on YouTube?**

Go to <https://www.youtube.com/> from your desktop or open the YouTube app from your phone. Log in to your account if it is not open.

1. The next step is to find the video where the comment is. You can search for it by tapping on the search button at the top of the YouTube homepage. Or you can locate it from your YouTube History.

To find your History from your desktop, you need to click on the three horizontal lines at the top left corner of the homepage. You will find the History option from the list. To access it from your phone, click on the Library option at the bottom of your homepage, and it will open a list where you will find the History option.

1. Open the video, and scroll down to locate the comment you want to report.
2. Once you find your target comment, click on the three vertical dots that appear on its right side. You will find the Report option from the pop-up menu. Click on that.
3. When you tap Report, another dialogue box will appear. From the list of options, choose the most appropriate option, tap on Report at the lower right corner of the pop-up, and complete the process. YouTube will do the rest.

## How to Delete All Your Posted YouTube Comments?

You can also delete all comments you ever posted on any YouTube video by hiding your channel. When you do this, you can hide your video content temporarily. But it will irreversibly erase all your comments throughout YouTube. If you are curious, read on to know how you can do it.

1. You need to go to YouTube from your desktop and sign in to your account.
2. Next, you can either click on the profile icon at the top right corner or the three horizontal lines beside the YouTube logo on your homepage. From the list of options, click Settings.

1. Scroll down and select Delete Channel. Clicking it will not delete your account. When you click on Delete Channel, you will get two choices – ‘I want to hide my channel’ and ‘I want to permanently delete my content’. Select the first.

1. YouTube will now show you what will happen when you hide your channel. Check all the boxes to confirm that you understand, and then tap on Hide My Channel. YouTube will now delete all comments made by your account.
