## What Is a YouTube Video Background?

A **YouTube video background** is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.

Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

The main reasons include:

* Creates a meaningful connection;
* Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;
* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal **YouTube video background download**.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

## **5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas**

It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.

If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.

Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter **background for YouTube** in no time.

A green screen is a fun way to create different backgrounds for your videos, but that isn’t all you can use it for. Using a chroma key tool, like the [one in **Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can add animations and transitions into your videos.

Say, for example, that you want to make a video where you’re hanging out with a CGI alien. All you need is an alien green screen effect – an animated alien against a green background. In Filmora, you drag that alien effect into your PIP track and switch the green background to transparent.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Your alien buddy will be overlaid over your main clip, which will make it look like he is there with you. Sound like fun?

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can get green screen effects and animations for free.

* [Green Screen Animation](#animation)
* [BestGreenScreen](#best)
* [Bestofgreenscreen](#bestof)
* [All Design Creative](#alldesign)

![YouTube Green Screen Stock Footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-green-screen-effects.jpg)

## [GREEN SCREEN ANIMATION](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7DcAEWN8dna2A%5FKYSSslQ/featured)

This YouTube channel posts something new every day. Their effects include overlays, transitions, titles, and animations. Everything is free, but they do request that you link back to them in your video description if you monetize.

At GREEN SCREEN ANIMATION you will find lots of corporate and tech-industry effects, but they also have playlists of effects for makeup videos, military-themed effects, and animations inspired by movies (among other things).

## [BestGreenScreen](https://www.youtube.com/user/bestgreenscreen/featured)

This channel specializes in action and sci-fi effects. Zombies, spaceships, and bullets are among their specialties, and many of their effects are inspired by movies like Star Wars. If you’re not into that kind of thing, they also have some nice overlays of things like mist or moving clouds. BestGreenScreen posts multiple times a week.

## [bestofgreenscreen](https://www.youtube.com/user/bestofgreenscreen/featured)

Bestofgreenscreen hasn’t posted anything new in a long time, but there is a huge existing catalog of free effects. There are a lot of action/military-themed effects (like explosions), as well as sci-fi and fantasy-themed things like dragons.

Beyond that, there are a lot of animals and nature-themed effects.

## [ALLDesignCreative](https://www.youtube.com/user/alldesigncreative)

Here you’ll find things like fog, ripples, waves, and falling flowers – in short, overlays. There are lots of cool overlays included in Filmora, or available through our effects store, and if you go hunting through this and other free green screens/chroma key effect channels you can find even more.

**Note:** to obtain most of these effects, you will need to use a service that allows you to save/download YouTube videos.

One of the easiest ways to save videos is by using Save From. Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like **<http://www.ssyoutube>**). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.

Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen? We'd love to see it, share it in the comments.

This channel specializes in action and sci-fi effects. Zombies, spaceships, and bullets are among their specialties, and many of their effects are inspired by movies like Star Wars. If you’re not into that kind of thing, they also have some nice overlays of things like mist or moving clouds. BestGreenScreen posts multiple times a week.

Bestofgreenscreen hasn’t posted anything new in a long time, but there is a huge existing catalog of free effects. There are a lot of action/military-themed effects (like explosions), as well as sci-fi and fantasy-themed things like dragons.

Beyond that, there are a lot of animals and nature-themed effects.

Here you’ll find things like fog, ripples, waves, and falling flowers – in short, overlays. There are lots of cool overlays included in Filmora, or available through our effects store, and if you go hunting through this and other free green screens/chroma key effect channels you can find even more.

**Note:** to obtain most of these effects, you will need to use a service that allows you to save/download YouTube videos.

One of the easiest ways to save videos is by using Save From. Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like **<http://www.ssyoutube>**). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.

Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen? We'd love to see it, share it in the comments.
