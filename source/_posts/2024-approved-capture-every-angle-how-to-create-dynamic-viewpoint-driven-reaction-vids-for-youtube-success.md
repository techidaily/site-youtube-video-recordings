Sharing ideas and opinions on virtually any topic you can think of with millions of people around the world is arguably one of the greatest benefits YouTube gives to content creators. Even so, building your channel exclusively around **reaction videos** may prove to be difficult, but this doesn’t mean that you can’t use this type of video to comment on what other YouTubers are saying.

The process of **making a YouTube reaction video** is not overly technical, although you will have to decide which video editing technique you are going to use to make a reaction video. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at different ways to make a YouTube reaction video.

* [Method 1: Making Reaction Videos with PIP feature in Filmora](#pip%5Ffilmora)
* [Method 2: Create YouTube Reaction Video with Split Screen Templates](#split%5Fscreen%5Ffilmora)
* [Method 3: Make A Reaction Video for YouTube with AI Portrait](#ai%5Fportrait%5Ffilmora)

## How to Make a Reaction Video for Your YouTube Channel? \[3 Ways\]

Using the footage without the consent of the copyright owner is punishable by the law, which means that you can only include the footage in a reaction video if you have the owner’s consent. Consequently, the selection of videos you can comment on is going to be limited, since it is entirely up to the creator of the video if they are going to give you permission to use their footage in your reaction video.

You can use the following video editing techniques, once you have access to the video you would like to comment on.

### Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora

Video editing software, like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), can also be used to create YouTube reaction videos, but you must have all the footage you would like to include in that video before you can start putting it together.

The first step is to create a new project in Filmora and then import the media assets into the editor. Besides video clips, you can also add music, pictures, or create opening titles and end credits for your reaction video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Place the video you’re reacting to on a video track on the timeline and then add the video of your reaction to the timeline that is directly above the one to which you added the first video clip. Click on the top video in the preview window and use the handles that are positioned around the edges of the video to adjust its size.

If you would like to change the on-screen position of the overlay clip, you should simply click on it and drag it to the new location within the preview window.

![Create reaction video with Filmora Picture in Picture feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-reaction-video-size-position.jpg)

Filmora offers more than sixty motion effects, hundreds of transitions, and visual effects that can make your reaction video more visually appealing to the audience.

Moreover, Filmora video editing software offers a variety of blending modes, and it lets you control the opacity of the overlay video so that you can make it more transparent. Whether or not you are going to use these options depends on the footage you’re working with and the demands of a particular project.

## How to Avoid Copyright Infringements While Making a YouTube Reaction Video

All videos you can find on YouTube are protected by intellectual property regulations, and you can’t use them without the copyright owner’s permission. The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.

In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.

Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.

There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention. Which video editing techniques are you using to make a YouTube reaction video?

The process of **making a YouTube reaction video** is not overly technical, although you will have to decide which video editing technique you are going to use to make a reaction video. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at different ways to make a YouTube reaction video.

## How to Make a Reaction Video for Your YouTube Channel? \[3 Ways\]

Using the footage without the consent of the copyright owner is punishable by the law, which means that you can only include the footage in a reaction video if you have the owner’s consent. Consequently, the selection of videos you can comment on is going to be limited, since it is entirely up to the creator of the video if they are going to give you permission to use their footage in your reaction video.

You can use the following video editing techniques, once you have access to the video you would like to comment on.

### Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora

Video editing software, like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), can also be used to create YouTube reaction videos, but you must have all the footage you would like to include in that video before you can start putting it together.

The first step is to create a new project in Filmora and then import the media assets into the editor. Besides video clips, you can also add music, pictures, or create opening titles and end credits for your reaction video.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Place the video you’re reacting to on a video track on the timeline and then add the video of your reaction to the timeline that is directly above the one to which you added the first video clip. Click on the top video in the preview window and use the handles that are positioned around the edges of the video to adjust its size.

If you would like to change the on-screen position of the overlay clip, you should simply click on it and drag it to the new location within the preview window.

![Create reaction video with Filmora Picture in Picture feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-reaction-video-size-position.jpg)

Filmora offers more than sixty motion effects, hundreds of transitions, and visual effects that can make your reaction video more visually appealing to the audience.

![Filmora  compositing with Blending modes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg)

Moreover, Filmora video editing software offers a variety of blending modes, and it lets you control the opacity of the overlay video so that you can make it more transparent. Whether or not you are going to use these options depends on the footage you’re working with and the demands of a particular project.

**Pros of using the Picture in Picture feature to make reaction videos in Filmora:** You can place and adjust the videos with more customizable options. Get more tips about [Making a PIP video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### Method 2: Create several reaction windows with the Split Screen feature

Besides the Picture-in-Picture option, Filmora also enables you to [play two or more videos simultaneously](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Split Screen templates. Drag and drop the template you want to use in your reaction video to the timeline and click on the Enable Split Screen Animation tick box if you want to use the template without animations.

![create reaction video with Filmora  Split Screen Templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-split-screen.jpg)

Afterward, you should drag the video clips from the Media tab and drop them onto the section of the preview window where you want them to be located. Keep in mind that you cannot add more than six videos to a split-screen template.

![Filmora  Edit Reaction Video with Split Screen Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reaction-video-advanced-split-screen-edit.jpg)

All videos you add to a split-screen template can be edited, and you just have to click on them if you want to adjust their sizes, enhance colors, mute their audio tracks or add a new audio file to the template.

### Method 3: Create A YouTube Reaction Video with AI Portrait

With the human segmentation effect in AI Portrait, you can now blend the reaction video in a more natural way. The human segmentation effect will isolate people from the background, you can use any background in the video.

Note: You can use this feature after version after V 10.5 for Windows, and V 10.4 for Mac. Click the button below to get the latest version of Filmora on your desktop.

**Step 1:** Import the videos to the media library, and then drag the background video to the first video track, and the reaction video to the track above.

![import reaction videos to Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-reaction-videos-to-timeline.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the Effects tab at the top, and click the AI Portrait category, and then you will see many effects such as Human Segmentation, Human Pixelate, Human Noise, and lighting flash. Here, drag and drop the Human segmentation effect to the reaction video.

![make reaction video: remove video background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-video-background-reaction-video.jpg)

**Step 3**: Select the reaction video in the timeline, and then adjust its size and position by dragging it on the preview window. See, the reaction video is fine blended with the background video.

![adjust reaction video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-reaction-video-size.jpg)

**Step 4:** That’s the basic editing of making a reaction video. You can also add the neon or flashing effect to the video. If everything goes well, click Export and save the video.

## How to Avoid Copyright Infringements While Making a YouTube Reaction Video

All videos you can find on YouTube are protected by intellectual property regulations, and you can’t use them without the copyright owner’s permission. The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.

In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.

Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.

There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.

**Conclusion**

Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention. Which video editing techniques are you using to make a YouTube reaction video?

There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as [important as subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html).

Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing. Understanding who your audience is will enable you to come up with the content for your channel that is more perfectly suited to the tastes of the majority you’re your subscribers. Even though YouTube allows you to see who your subscribers are, monitoring the sub count in real time requires the use of subscriber trackers or counters ([more interested in seeing exactly who your subscribers are?](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/see-all-your-subscribers-on-youtube---easy-297.html)).

If you would like to keep track of the ever-changing number of subscribers to your channel, or gather information such as the sub counts and views of other YouTube channels, then using a live subscriber counter is a good choice.

Here are the top 12 YouTube subscriber counters:

* [Social Blade](#socialblade)
* [Subscribercounter.com](#subscribercounter)
* [Akshatmittal.com](#akshatmittal)
* [LiveCounts.net](#livecounts)
* [Grin.co](#grin)

This website doesn't provide advanced statistics, but it is easy to use. If all you need to find out the number of subscribers of a channel, insert the channel's name into the search box. The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don't expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.

There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as [important as subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html).

Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing. Understanding who your audience is will enable you to come up with the content for your channel that is more perfectly suited to the tastes of the majority you’re your subscribers. Even though YouTube allows you to see who your subscribers are, monitoring the sub count in real time requires the use of subscriber trackers or counters ([more interested in seeing exactly who your subscribers are?](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/see-all-your-subscribers-on-youtube---easy-297.html)).

If you would like to keep track of the ever-changing number of subscribers to your channel, or gather information such as the sub counts and views of other YouTube channels, then using a live subscriber counter is a good choice.

Here are the top 12 YouTube subscriber counters:

* [Social Blade](#socialblade)
* [Subscribercounter.com](#subscribercounter)
* [Akshatmittal.com](#akshatmittal)
* [LiveCounts.net](#livecounts)
* [Grin.co](#grin)
* [YouCount.github.io](#youcount)
* [RealTimeSubCount.com](#realtimesubcount)
* [SubscriberCount.org](#subscribercount)
* [Live.SumScreen.com](#livesumscreen)
* [YTCount.com](#ytcount)
* [Realtime Subscriber Count](#realtimesubscriber)
* [Realtime Sub Count](#realtimesub)

## Top 12 Best YouTuber Subscriber Trackers You Should Use

### 1. Social Blade

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker - Social Blade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-social-blade.jpg)

This is probably the best tool you can use to monitor how the number of subscribers to any YouTube channel changes in from second to second. What's more, Social Blade allows you to compare up to three different YouTube channels and you can also keep track of the number of subscribers top channels on YouTube have. In addition, you will be able to see how many videos they have uploaded and how many views they got. To start monitoring sub counts live via Social Blade simply enter the name of a channel and let the algorithm do the rest.

### 2. Subscribercounter.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker Subscribercounter.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-subscribercounter.jpg)

This website doesn't provide advanced statistics, but it is easy to use. If all you need to find out the number of subscribers of a channel, insert the channel's name into the search box. The search results also include the number of videos featured on the YouTube channel as well as the number of views. Subscriber Counter is an easy-to-use tool, but just don't expect much more than basic information from this live subscriber tracker.

### 3. Akshatmittal.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Akshatmittal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-akshatmittal.jpg)

The users of this tool can get the accurate number of subscribers for any YouTube channel in real time and they are also granted an insight into the number of views and comments a channel has received and how many videos are uploaded to it. Channel username, channel ID, YouTube URL can all be used as search terms on Askat Mittal's YouTube Real-time subscriber counter.

A fringe bonus of Askat Mittal’s service is that the information is all displayed beautifully alongside the channel art of the YouTubers you look up.

### 4. LiveCounts.net

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: livecounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-livecounts.jpg)

If you are in need of an easy-to-use YouTube subscriber counter, then LiveCounts is a strong option. However, if you want to learn more about a YouTube channel than its subscriber count, such as the number of videos a creator has uploaded, how many views they have received, or how many comments their videos have, then LiveCounts may not be a good choice since it only monitors subscriber numbers in real time. There is a views tool, but it does not appear to be working.

On LiveCounts you can change the color of the display background.

### 5. Grin.co

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: Grin.co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-grin-io.jpg)

Grin.co is a California-based company that provides services for marketers has designed a perfect sub count tool that enables you to know the exact number of subscribers for any YouTube account. Furthermore, this easy to use real-time subscriber counter allows you to share the latest statistics about your YouTube's leading channel easily to Facebook or Twitter. You can either search the channels by entering the user or a channel name into the search bar.

### 6. YouCount.github.io

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: YouCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-youcount.jpg)

YouTube creators in need of an advanced real-time subscriber count tool will without a doubt benefit from YouCount. Besides a live subscriber counter, YouCount also provides advanced statistics such as real-time trends with a 30-second refresh rate as well as information about total views or the number of videos the channel you are researching features.

Some of the more unique tools on YouCount allow you to compare a channel’s recent success (the statistics of the last 5 videos posted there) with the popularity of the channel as a whole. This is a good way to see if a channel is picking up momentum.

### 7. RealTimeSubCount.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: RealTimeSubCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-sub-tracker-realtimesubcount.jpg)

Getting real-time statistics from the YouTube Subscriber Count is easy because all you need to do in order to get an exact number of subscribers for your channel, or any other YouTube channel, is to type the channel's name into the search box. There is also an app for Android Smartphones available if you like to work on your smartphone. The version of the app for iPhones should become available in the near future.

### 8. SubscriberCount.org

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/SubscriberCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Information like the number of video uploads, views, and the creation date of the YouTube channel are all easily accessible via the SubscriberCount website. Simply insert the name or the URL of the channel you'd like to find out more about and enjoy the benefits. After you've made your search query the website will automatically suggest similar YouTube channels which can be a great way to discover new channels and find interesting content.

### 9.  Live.SumScreen.com

![Free YouTube Subscriber Tracker: SubscriberCount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/live-sum-screen-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

You can either insert the name (or the ID sequence from the channel’s URL if the channel doesn’t have a custom URL) of the channel into the search bar on the website's welcome screen and be just one click away from real-time subscriber counts.

\[Update August 21, 2018: Live.SumScreen tracker feature is currently unavailable\]

### 10. YTCount.com

![YT Count YouTube Subscribers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YTCount-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

This is a website that offers an app you can use on your [iPhone, iPad or iPad Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ytcount-subscriber-count/id1091736385?mt=8), or even on your [Android smartphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ytcount). All versions of the app are free to download and allow you to follow several YouTube channels simultaneously, receive a notification every time you reach a milestone, and customize the app however you want. YT Count will enable you to analyze the statistics of any YouTube channel and monitor the latest changes in real-time.

### 11. Realtime Subscriber Count

![Realtime Subscriber Count](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-subscriber-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

Although remarkably easy to use this Google Chrome extension doesn't offer much more than basic statistics, such as the current number of subscribers or the number of videos the channel features. YouTubers who are looking for more advanced analysis of data should look elsewhere because this extension doesn't provide any additional information. Realtime Subscriber Count is a great way to keep track of subscriber numbers while you browse, but that is all it can do.

### 12. Realtime Sub Count

![YouTube Sub Count app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/realtime-sub-count-youtube-subs-tracker.jpg)

The Realtime Sub Count app is only available for iOS devices. This app was launched in April 2017 and, even though it provides some detailed information, it is still under development. If you decide to download this app you will be able to save your favorite channels and always get accurate data for them. The app updates every two seconds.
