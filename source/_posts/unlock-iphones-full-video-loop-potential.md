It makes sense then that vertical is the preferred familiarization for videos. Users don't want to twist their phones to watch a 30-second ad. Knowing [YouTube shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) vertical size is important as well as Facebook vertical video specs.

Social juggernauts like Facebook and YouTube have adopted vertical video size or formats in current years. The newer social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok, use vertical video completely. While most platforms now prefer vertical video, they each have different patterns. Even Instagram vertical video dimensions premiere is different.

Users tinkering in video marketing know it's essential to stay updated on social media video sizes across all platforms.

01 [What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?](#Part 1)

02 [Vertical Video Dimension for Different Social Apps](#Part 2)

03 [Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

## Part 2 Vertical Video Dimension for Different Social Apps

Here is a guide on how to shoot vertical dimensions for various social apps –

### 1\. YouTube Vertical Video Dimension Guide

It is common for viewers to switch to YouTube and watch videos, and this is why you need the work on the perfect YouTube vertical video size. Initially, you could display YouTube videos in different dimensions, but this is no longer the case since the app’s dynamic innovation to view animations in preferred sizes.

![youtube vertical video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-6.jpg)

Usually, YouTube videos are recorded at a standard aspect ratio of 16: 9\. It means that you cannot customize the dimensions as this is this ratio is the default.

Though the 16:9 dimensions are standard, you can also shoot your videos using different ratios like 1:1 (square), 4:3, or 9:16 (vertically). In this case, your video will fit different YouTube videos on each device but will display white or grey padding on the frames by default.

Manually adding padding to your videos reduces the ability to adjust them to different ratios on various devices. If you are yet to switch to YouTube vertical video dimensions, you are missing to increase brand awareness.

### 2\. Facebook Vertical Video Dimension Guide

Facebook vertical video specs have mainly been using the 16:9 ratio. And since the app attracts billions of global users, it’s high time to optimize your snapshots and try posting in different formats.

![fb vertical video size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-2.jpg)

For your next FB vertical video size for feed videos, think of square snapshots (1:1), 2:3, 4:5, or 16:9\. If you love creating Facebook stories, you can stick to the 9:16 ratio. And for Facebook live videos, stick with the Facebook video vertical size, 16:9 dimensions. Note that most Facebook video posts will automatically have a standard measurement of 16:9.

3\. Instagram Vertical Video Dimensions Guide

Since the inception of Instagram vertical video dimensions premiere, the ratio has always been 1:1\. This dimension makes it optimal for phones and small-sized screens. Here is the ultimate guide for your new Instagram animations:

* 1:1 for square videos.
* 4:5 for portrait shots.
* 9:16 when shooting vertical animations.

If you are going live on Instagram, we recommend 9:16, while you can shoot in 1:1, 4:5, and 16:9 ratios for feed videos. For Instagram stories, we suggest 9:16, but you can always work around 1:1, 4:9, and 16:9.

![Instagram vertical video dimensions premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-3.jpg)

### Method 2: Final Cut Pro

Apple's Final Cut Pro is a compelling software for video editing and compositing. The interface is designed similar with many other video editing programs such as Adobe Premiere and Combustion etc.

**Step 3:** The iPhone compresses MP4 video. While editing a simple project, you don't need to generate optimized media. However, optimizing media will save you time in the long run if you plan to add lots of effects.

**Step 4:** Now, generate a new project and apply the Automatic settings.

**Step 5:** Next, edit a vertical clip into the empty new project. Even if this isn't the first clip you want the audience to see, it is essential because FCP uses this clip to configure the project settings.

**Step 6:** When that first video clip is edited into the timeline, this dialog arrives. Note that the frame size is already fixed by the size of the video you shot on the iPhone. Don't change any settings. It allows FCP to automatically configure the project to match the specs of this clip. If you've done this correctly, your clip appears vertically in the Viewer.

03 [Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Vertical Video Size Do We Usually Use?

Videos come in different sizes. However, one principle is standard in creating them, the vertical video aspect ratio (width to height). This refers to how you compare and create the video height to video ratio (how you intend to record and produce your video).

Ideally, it is what you and viewers will see while watching your video. To create a perfect video, any video creator should decide on the relationship between the video height and width.

When creating YouTube vertical video dimensions, the width is usually longer than the height. Most television videos have a standard ratio of 4:3 and 16:9\. However, social media videos are created using a 1:1 and 9:16 ratio.

![social media video dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/dimension-aspect-ratio-4.jpg)

A smartphone can shoot vertical videos perfectly, but some media players like cameras require editing and adjusting the sizes to get the correct aspect ratio. Experts won’t have difficulties adjusting horizontally shot videos, but an amateur will. Fortunately, you can avoid taking unprofessional shoots by focusing on the frame’s center to capture your subject wholly without clipping important aspects. While editing Facebook vertical video dimensions and other social apps, the results could vary depending on the editing software. But you can rotate the video within the software to get the correct dimensions lest you get ugly videos full of black backgrounds filling the frame.

Most cameras and video recorders have inbuilt settings that switch to aspect ratio when you start recording. And the good thing is that you can adjust the settings to your desired dimensions in the settings section. If you are shooting a vertical video without a preset aspect ratio, then:

* Shoot gently without switching your camera horizontally, especially if you are capturing a narrow view.
* Avoid fast spans as it appears intense on the camera that could result in blurry animations.
* Focus on what you are capturing, and if need be, zoom in to capture every essential detail.

The importance of applying aspect ratio in videos is to ensure your images and videos have excellent resolution. This way, you have a chance to present (market) your idea professionally.

## Part 3 Tips: How to Adjust Vertical Videos Size

The smartphone has become the primary tool for taking photos or recording videos, but we hold our mobile phone in a different direction while shooting videos, which causes the wrong adjustment while uploading it. Fortunately, there are ways, and your video can fit any screen without any compromises. Bellow, we are going to tell you two methods to adjust vertical video size

### Method 1: [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora allows users to rotate your video to any point they want. What's more, you can zoom in or crop the undesired parts in the video with a snap. It also offers you preset aspect ratios like 16:9, 9:16; 4:5, 1:1, etc., to help you quickly find the perfect aspect ratio for YouTube, Instagram, and other social apps. Let's see how to change video adjustment in Filmora.

**How to crop aspect ratio at the starting interface:**

In this method, you must upload the animation first. Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Upload your video into the editing panel.

**Step2:** Scroll to the drop-down menu to see various dimensions (1:1\. 4:3, 9:16, 16:9, and 21:9).

**Step3:** Select the desired ratio and apply.

**Modifying aspect ratio in project settings:**

This method allows you to preset the ratios before uploading your media. Most files are preset to a 4:3 ratio, but you can adjust as you wish. Note that uploading a video with other aspect ratios will automatically switch to the default one. However, you can change the ratio by clicking on the project settings tab.

You can also modify the aspect ratio manually, add filters, and blur the background to enhance resolution when editing.

**Auto reframing:**

Latest Filmora running versions like V10.5 have the auto-reframe feature that can help crop aspect ratio seamlessly. The good thing about this feature is that it detects any object and can remove it if need be. Plus, this [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) also comes with preset aspect ratios that conveniently suit different social apps.

You can auto reframe by:

### Method 2: Final Cut Pro

Apple's Final Cut Pro is a compelling software for video editing and compositing. The interface is designed similar with many other video editing programs such as Adobe Premiere and Combustion etc.

**To prepare:**

* Take vertical videos.
* Connect iPhone to an editing system.
* Enter a password on the iPhone.
* Started Final Cut Pro.
* Create a new library, named it "Vertical Video".

**Steps to adjust vertical video size with Final cut pro:**

**Step 1:** To import the video clip, you want to edit, click on the File > Import Media. The connected iPhone screen appears in the top left corner. The circle icon shows that FCP is still collecting data from the phone and the pointing arrow allows to disconnect.

**Step 2:** When the iPhone is chosen in the sidebar, thumbnails appear at the bottom of the Media Import window. For example, you can see the four vertical video clips, choose one to edit.

**Step 3:** The iPhone compresses MP4 video. While editing a simple project, you don't need to generate optimized media. However, optimizing media will save you time in the long run if you plan to add lots of effects.

**Step 4:** Now, generate a new project and apply the Automatic settings.

**Step 5:** Next, edit a vertical clip into the empty new project. Even if this isn't the first clip you want the audience to see, it is essential because FCP uses this clip to configure the project settings.

**Step 6:** When that first video clip is edited into the timeline, this dialog arrives. Note that the frame size is already fixed by the size of the video you shot on the iPhone. Don't change any settings. It allows FCP to automatically configure the project to match the specs of this clip. If you've done this correctly, your clip appears vertically in the Viewer.
