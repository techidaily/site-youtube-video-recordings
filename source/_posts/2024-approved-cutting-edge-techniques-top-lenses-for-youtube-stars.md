A DSLR is the ideal camera for some vlogs, and using a DSLR means you get to customize the look of your vlog by choosing the perfect lens. Choosing the best camera lens for your YouTube channel can be tricky because there are so many options. This article will walk you through some of them, and make two recommendations of great vlogging lenses. If you already have a good understanding of how camera lenses work then feel free to scroll down to the lens recs.

## Part 1\. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop

There are two main categories of camera lenses: ‘zoom’ – lenses that allow you to zoom in and out – and ‘fixed’. If your lenses are tools then zoom lenses are Swiss army knives; they are very versatile. Fixed lenses, also called prime lenses, have more specific purposes. Do you need a tool that can do a lot of things, or a tool that is perfect for one specific job? Sometimes it is useful to have access to both.

We have explained the differences between Fixed lens and Zoom lens and advantages of using each lens, check this article: [Zoom Lens vs. Fixed Lenses: Which one is best for YouTuber?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for the detailed information.

Before we get into the recommendations here is a little background information on lenses in general:

### Beginner's Guide to Aperture and F-Stops

In order to be able to select the lens you'll be using to record your YouTube videos, you first need to understand a few very basic concepts, such as aperture or f-stops.

#### 1.What is a lens’s aperture?

The aperture of your lens is the hole through which light reaches your camera’s sensor, or the film if you are using a film camera. The wider your aperture is the more light you are letting into your camera. In low light it is better to have a wide aperture, and when you are working with a lot of light it is better to have a narrow aperture so your footage is not overexposed.

**Aperture** is simply an opening in the lens that lets the light through. If you want to increase the amount of the light that is reaching the camera's sensor you need to open up the aperture blades that are located in the lens. The **f-values** like f/1.2 or f/1.8 indicate that the aperture is wide open and that the camera is receiving the maximum amount of light a lens you're using can provide.

#### 2.What is an ‘f-stop’?

Light passes through your lens’s aperture on its way to your camera’s sensor, and the f-stop of your lens relates to the amount of light it lets in. The lower your f-stop, the wider your aperture, and the more light you are letting into your camera. The more light you let into your camera the easier it is to achieve a blurred background. A lot of vloggers love blurring their backgrounds because it is a quick way to disguising the rooms they are shooting in.

F-stops are written like ‘f/1.8’ or ‘f/4’ on your lens. For more information on f-stops and blurring your background read “The Best Bokeh Lens - How to Get the Blurred Background for YouTube Videos” and watch Tasha’s video.

**F-stops** or f-numbers indicate how open the aperture is, so for example if your camera is displaying f/32 value it means that your camera is letting very little light to get through to the camera's sensor. The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.

## Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses

The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you'll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That's why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you'll encounter.

#### Standard lenses

These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard. You can use them to capture medium shots, single or multiple figure shots, and in some cases establishing shots, because they offer enough versatility to cover a multitude of different scenes. Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can't control.

#### Macro lenses

Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What's more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.

#### Telephoto lenses

The subjects of your videos don't always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don't have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.

#### Wide-angle lenses

Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.

#### Specialist lenses

YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you'll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.

## Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos

Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel. The thing that makes them both ideal for vlogging is that they have low enough f-stops to blur out your background.

| Camera Lens                                  | **Type**      | **Price** | **Aperture** | **Focal Length** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens** | Wide angle    | $279      | f/4.5-5.6    | 10 -18mm         |
| **Rokinon 8mm f/3.5**                        | Fisheye       | $249      | f/3.5        | 8mm              |
| **Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens**                | Prime         | $125      | f/1.8        | 50mm             |
| **Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens**             | Telephoto     | $999      | f/2          | 135mm            |
| **Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8**               | Standard Zoom | $299      | f/2.8        | 17 -50mm         |
| **Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro**                    | Macro         | $278      | f/3.5        | 30mm             |

#### 1.[Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039090&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+10-18mm+f/4.5-5.6&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=81cf63202a546809712746fdac765188&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.L)

Canon released this lens in 2014 and shortly after it has gained the reputation of one of the most reliable wide to **ultra-wide lenses** for Canon cameras. Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly **fast autofocus technology** that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an **image stabilization system** which guarantees that your videos are going to remain **sharp** even if the camera wasn't perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens **poor choice for low light scenes**, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.

#### 2. [Rokinon 8mm Ultra Wide f/3.5 Fisheye Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Rokinon-Fisheye-Aperture-Exposure-AE8M-N/dp/B006O7158O/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039440&sr=8-2&keywords=Rokinon+8mm+f/3.5+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=49cad7e243ca97acbda08212482dcbe5&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O)

**Outdoor videos** look much cooler when they are recorded with a **wide-angle lens** because the wider field of view enables you to capture more space in a shot. **Fisheye lenses** were made popular by GoPro cameras because they make the videos look more fun while producing high image quality. Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to **adjust focus and aperture manually** so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is **compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.** It has a relatively **fast aperture** that enables it to deliver **solid performances under low light conditions**.

#### 3.[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=cd09588b67ac10e4e960ea45c87b3f06&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slotNum=4)

![camera lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG)

The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.

If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon's 50mm prime lenses, although the [50mm f/1.4 USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe) and [50mm f/1.2 'L' USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot) models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f/1.8 STM lens doesn't have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.

#### 4.[Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-135mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000053HC5/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439038618&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+EF+135mm+f/2+L+USM+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=3ef39fe6c476b0dab7cf573810e16103&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoY)

Recording **moving objects** from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2/L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon's telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can't increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.

#### 5.[Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8)

![camera lens rec02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG)

The Tamron's standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f/2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f/32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different **depths of field.** The lens is **compatible with most Canon cameras** so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is **highly versatile** and you can use it to record **a wide range of different scenes**.

A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f/2.8\. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.

#### 6.[Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/791322-REG/Sony%5FSEL30M35%5F30mm%5Ff%5F3%5F5%5FWide%5FAngle%5FLens.html)

All Sony's APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn't really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f/3.5 and f/22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.

![camera lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG)

The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.

If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon's 50mm prime lenses, although the [50mm f/1.4 USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe) and [50mm f/1.2 'L' USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot) models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f/1.8 STM lens doesn't have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.

#### 4.[Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-135mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000053HC5/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439038618&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+EF+135mm+f/2+L+USM+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=3ef39fe6c476b0dab7cf573810e16103&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoY)

Recording **moving objects** from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2/L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon's telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can't increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.

#### 5.[Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8)

![camera lens rec02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG)

The Tamron's standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f/2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f/32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different **depths of field.** The lens is **compatible with most Canon cameras** so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is **highly versatile** and you can use it to record **a wide range of different scenes**.

A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f/2.8\. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.

#### 6.[Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/791322-REG/Sony%5FSEL30M35%5F30mm%5Ff%5F3%5F5%5FWide%5FAngle%5FLens.html)

All Sony's APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn't really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f/3.5 and f/22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.

A DSLR is the ideal camera for some vlogs, and using a DSLR means you get to customize the look of your vlog by choosing the perfect lens. Choosing the best camera lens for your YouTube channel can be tricky because there are so many options. This article will walk you through some of them, and make two recommendations of great vlogging lenses. If you already have a good understanding of how camera lenses work then feel free to scroll down to the lens recs.

## Part 1\. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop

There are two main categories of camera lenses: ‘zoom’ – lenses that allow you to zoom in and out – and ‘fixed’. If your lenses are tools then zoom lenses are Swiss army knives; they are very versatile. Fixed lenses, also called prime lenses, have more specific purposes. Do you need a tool that can do a lot of things, or a tool that is perfect for one specific job? Sometimes it is useful to have access to both.

We have explained the differences between Fixed lens and Zoom lens and advantages of using each lens, check this article: [Zoom Lens vs. Fixed Lenses: Which one is best for YouTuber?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for the detailed information.

Before we get into the recommendations here is a little background information on lenses in general:

### Beginner's Guide to Aperture and F-Stops

In order to be able to select the lens you'll be using to record your YouTube videos, you first need to understand a few very basic concepts, such as aperture or f-stops.

#### 1.What is a lens’s aperture?

The aperture of your lens is the hole through which light reaches your camera’s sensor, or the film if you are using a film camera. The wider your aperture is the more light you are letting into your camera. In low light it is better to have a wide aperture, and when you are working with a lot of light it is better to have a narrow aperture so your footage is not overexposed.

**Aperture** is simply an opening in the lens that lets the light through. If you want to increase the amount of the light that is reaching the camera's sensor you need to open up the aperture blades that are located in the lens. The **f-values** like f/1.2 or f/1.8 indicate that the aperture is wide open and that the camera is receiving the maximum amount of light a lens you're using can provide.

#### 2.What is an ‘f-stop’?

Light passes through your lens’s aperture on its way to your camera’s sensor, and the f-stop of your lens relates to the amount of light it lets in. The lower your f-stop, the wider your aperture, and the more light you are letting into your camera. The more light you let into your camera the easier it is to achieve a blurred background. A lot of vloggers love blurring their backgrounds because it is a quick way to disguising the rooms they are shooting in.

F-stops are written like ‘f/1.8’ or ‘f/4’ on your lens. For more information on f-stops and blurring your background read “The Best Bokeh Lens - How to Get the Blurred Background for YouTube Videos” and watch Tasha’s video.

**F-stops** or f-numbers indicate how open the aperture is, so for example if your camera is displaying f/32 value it means that your camera is letting very little light to get through to the camera's sensor. The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.

## Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses

The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you'll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That's why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you'll encounter.

#### Standard lenses

These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard. You can use them to capture medium shots, single or multiple figure shots, and in some cases establishing shots, because they offer enough versatility to cover a multitude of different scenes. Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can't control.

#### Macro lenses

Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What's more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.

#### Telephoto lenses

The subjects of your videos don't always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don't have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.

#### Wide-angle lenses

Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.

#### Specialist lenses

YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you'll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.

## Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos

Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel. The thing that makes them both ideal for vlogging is that they have low enough f-stops to blur out your background.

| Camera Lens                                  | **Type**      | **Price** | **Aperture** | **Focal Length** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens** | Wide angle    | $279      | f/4.5-5.6    | 10 -18mm         |
| **Rokinon 8mm f/3.5**                        | Fisheye       | $249      | f/3.5        | 8mm              |
| **Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens**                | Prime         | $125      | f/1.8        | 50mm             |
| **Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens**             | Telephoto     | $999      | f/2          | 135mm            |
| **Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8**               | Standard Zoom | $299      | f/2.8        | 17 -50mm         |
| **Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro**                    | Macro         | $278      | f/3.5        | 30mm             |

#### 1.[Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039090&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+10-18mm+f/4.5-5.6&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=81cf63202a546809712746fdac765188&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.L)

Canon released this lens in 2014 and shortly after it has gained the reputation of one of the most reliable wide to **ultra-wide lenses** for Canon cameras. Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly **fast autofocus technology** that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an **image stabilization system** which guarantees that your videos are going to remain **sharp** even if the camera wasn't perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens **poor choice for low light scenes**, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.

#### 2. [Rokinon 8mm Ultra Wide f/3.5 Fisheye Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Rokinon-Fisheye-Aperture-Exposure-AE8M-N/dp/B006O7158O/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039440&sr=8-2&keywords=Rokinon+8mm+f/3.5+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=49cad7e243ca97acbda08212482dcbe5&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O)

**Outdoor videos** look much cooler when they are recorded with a **wide-angle lens** because the wider field of view enables you to capture more space in a shot. **Fisheye lenses** were made popular by GoPro cameras because they make the videos look more fun while producing high image quality. Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to **adjust focus and aperture manually** so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is **compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.** It has a relatively **fast aperture** that enables it to deliver **solid performances under low light conditions**.

#### 3.[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=cd09588b67ac10e4e960ea45c87b3f06&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slotNum=4)

![camera lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG)

The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature.

Recording **moving objects** from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2/L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon's telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can't increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.

#### 5.[Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8)

![camera lens rec02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG)

The Tamron's standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f/2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f/32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different **depths of field.** The lens is **compatible with most Canon cameras** so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera.

A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f/2.8\. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.

All Sony's APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots.

The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.

## Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses

The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you'll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That's why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you'll encounter.

#### Standard lenses

These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard.

Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can't control.

Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What's more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.

#### Telephoto lenses

The subjects of your videos don't always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don't have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.

Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.

#### Specialist lenses

YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you'll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.

## Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos

Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel. The thing that makes them both ideal for vlogging is that they have low enough f-stops to blur out your background.

| Camera Lens                                  | **Type**      | **Price** | **Aperture** | **Focal Length** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens** | Wide angle    | $279      | f/4.5-5.6    | 10 -18mm         |
| **Rokinon 8mm f/3.5**                        | Fisheye       | $249      | f/3.5        | 8mm              |
| **Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens**                | Prime         | $125      | f/1.8        | 50mm             |
| **Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens**             | Telephoto     | $999      | f/2          | 135mm            |
| **Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8**               | Standard Zoom | $299      | f/2.8        | 17 -50mm         |
| **Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro**                    | Macro         | $278      | f/3.5        | 30mm             |

#### 1.[Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039090&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+10-18mm+f/4.5-5.6&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=81cf63202a546809712746fdac765188&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.L)

Canon released this lens in 2014 and shortly after it has gained the reputation of one of the most reliable wide to **ultra-wide lenses** for Canon cameras. Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly **fast autofocus technology** that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an **image stabilization system** which guarantees that your videos are going to remain **sharp** even if the camera wasn't perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens **poor choice for low light scenes**, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.

#### 2. [Rokinon 8mm Ultra Wide f/3.5 Fisheye Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Rokinon-Fisheye-Aperture-Exposure-AE8M-N/dp/B006O7158O/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439039440&sr=8-2&keywords=Rokinon+8mm+f/3.5+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=49cad7e243ca97acbda08212482dcbe5&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O)

**Outdoor videos** look much cooler when they are recorded with a **wide-angle lens** because the wider field of view enables you to capture more space in a shot. **Fisheye lenses** were made popular by GoPro cameras because they make the videos look more fun while producing high image quality. Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to **adjust focus and aperture manually** so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is **compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.** It has a relatively **fast aperture** that enables it to deliver **solid performances under low light conditions**.

#### 3.[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=cd09588b67ac10e4e960ea45c87b3f06&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slotNum=4)

![camera lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG)

The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.

If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon's 50mm prime lenses, although the [50mm f/1.4 USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe) and [50mm f/1.2 'L' USM](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot) models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f/1.8 STM lens doesn't have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.

#### 4.[Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-135mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000053HC5/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439038618&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+EF+135mm+f/2+L+USM+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=3ef39fe6c476b0dab7cf573810e16103&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoY)

Recording **moving objects** from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2/L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon's telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can't increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.

#### 5.[Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8)

![camera lens rec02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG)

The Tamron's standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f/2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f/32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different **depths of field.** The lens is **compatible with most Canon cameras** so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is **highly versatile** and you can use it to record **a wide range of different scenes**.

A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f/2.8\. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.

#### 6.[Sony 30mm f/3.5 Macro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/791322-REG/Sony%5FSEL30M35%5F30mm%5Ff%5F3%5F5%5FWide%5FAngle%5FLens.html)

All Sony's APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn't really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f/3.5 and f/22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.

### Part 1: What is YouTube channel art?

YouTube channel art includes thumbnails, banners, watermarks, and icons. Thumbnails will help viewers decide to watch your videos, and a personalized banner will tell people who you are and what your vlog is about. Watermarks both label your work as yours and protect it from theft. Your icon is the avatar you will use to communicate with your subscribers. You can totally change the look and feel of the page and the changes will carry forwards for the page display on all platforms. However, the elements might look slightly different on desktops, mobile devices, and TV screens.

#### 1. Banner

A banner sits at the top of your channel, welcoming viewers to your videos and promoting your brand. Having your brand front and center here is a great plan, as it gives people confidence in who they are watching, as well as raising your brand profile on the platform.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Size**: 2560x1440px recommended. Cannot be smaller than 2048x1152px.

**Safe Area for All Devices**: 1546x423px

**File Size**: 6MB or smaller

**Do:**

\- Make sure all your text is in the safe area

\- Include channel information like what kinds of videos you make and your upload days

\- Add social media links

**Don’t:**

\- Use a font or font color that’s hard to read at a glance

\- Put a busy background or photo directly behind your text (put a solid background in-between)

 **How to Upload a YouTube Banner / Channel Art**

Go to My Channel and select Add channel art near the top of the screen (if this is the first time), or hover over your existing channel art to make the edit icon show up.

#### 2\.  Watermark

Watermarking your videos, banner and other content you produce can help protect your hard work. Sharing should be encouraged on YouTube, but you should absolutely get the credit for your content. A watermark ensures your brand is being acknowledged whenever someone hits the share button.

#### 3\.  Thumbnail

Developing unique thumbnails can really encourage more video views. Rather than just using a still from your actual video, you can create unique art to accompany each upload, describing what’s within the video and motivating people to watch.

**Size:** 1289x720px recommended. Width cannot be less than 640px.

**File Size:** 2MB or smaller

**Format:** .JPG, .GIF (no moving GIFS), .BMP, .PNG

**Do:**

**\-** Use colors that stand out

**\-**  Have a consistent format (all your thumbnails should have the same basic layout)

**\-** Include your face (or a character’s face, if you’re a gamer)

**\-** Show viewers what your video is about

**Don’t:**

**\-** Include anything sexually suggestive or violent.

**\-** Write more than 3 words or use a small font

**How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail**

In the screen right after you’ve uploaded a video (in your Creator Studio), select **Custom thumbnail** under **Video thumbnails** after you upload a video.

OR

Select **Edit** next to your video in the **Video Manager/Creator Studio**. In the preview screen, click **Custom thumbnail**.

#### 4\.  Icon or logo

If you’re building a brand on YouTube, you should absolutely have a recognizable logo or, at least, an icon that is unique to you. This way you’ll start to be recognized whenever people stumble across your footage, even if it’s on another platform such as Facebook.

**Size:** 800x800px recommended. Can be square or round, but must render to 98x98px.

**Format:** JPG, GIF (no animated GIFs), BMP, PNG

**Do:**

**\-** Use a close up of your face (if you want a custom URL: only channels that use photos as icons qualify)

**\-** Use a simple logo (if that’s more on-brand for you)

**Don’t:**

**\-** Use a full-body picture (it won’t look good shrunk down)

**\-** Use a picture of a celebrity or an image that falls under someone else’s copyright

**How to Upload a YouTube Profile Picture / Icon**

Go to **My Channel**, hover over your existing channel icon, and click the **edit icon** (looks like a pencil). Then, click **Edit**.

#### 5\.  Channel art links

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-links.jpg)

Adding links to your YouTube channel is a no-brainer. After all, if people love your channel, why not get them engaged on your social networks and website too? Adding links is easy in the Creator Studio, and you can choose to have links overlaid on your channel art too.

#### 6\.  YouTube Intros

**Ideal Length:** under 10 seconds is alright. Under 5 seconds is better.

**Placement:** within the first 30 seconds of your video.

**Do:**

**\-** Use music

**\-**  Include colors and images that match your personal brand

**\-** Include the name of your channel

**Don’t:**

**\-**  Make it longer than 10 seconds

**How to Add a YouTube Intro**

Add your intro before you upload using your video editing software. It’s best to create it in a separate project and export it as a clip you can re-use in all your videos. Click here to download some [free intros](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7\. [YouTube End Screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) / [Outros](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Length:** 5-20 seconds

**Placement:** the last 5-20 seconds of your video

Your video must be at least 25 seconds in order to add an end screen.

#### **Do:**

**\-** Link to at least 1 video or playlist

**\-** Prompt viewers to subscribe

**\-** Include social icons and handles so people can find you

**Don’t:**

**\-** Overcrowd the screen with options (it makes people less likely to click anything)

### Part 2: YouTube Channel Art Dimensions & Image Size Checklist

![YouTube channel art dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-dimension.jpg)

Getting the sizing of your channel art right is crucial. If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:

* The file size must not exceed 6MB
* The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels
* The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels
* The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels

**The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:**

* Mobile:1546px \* 423px
* Tablet :1855px \* 423px
* Desktop:2560px \* 423px
* TV:2560px \* 1440px

You see, YouTube channel art 2560\*1440 px is ideal for TV devices. If you’re not sure about the width and height of the channel art image, you can download the [Channel Art Templates from YouTube Official Site](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en) to check.

Keeping in mind people will access your channel on a variety of screen sizes, you’re going to need to design channel art that fits within these proportions and displays correctly no matter how it’s viewed. Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.

### Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?

If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial. Rather than simply having a place to upload some videos, your YouTube channel can become a powerful marketing tool for promoting your brand and values.

According to research, we are a highly visual species. 65 percent of people learn better visually, and when you’re thinking about retaining information, 90 percent of what we store in our brains is visual information. By presenting your viewers with visual content, you’re helping them take it in, retain it better and remember you for the future.

### Part 4: Tips for Making Channel Art

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-tips.jpg)

#### 1\. Tips for Making Thumbnails

A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.

One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.

If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.

#### 2\. Tips for Making Watermarks

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

#### 3\. Tips for Making Icons

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

### Part 5: Best Free & Paid YouTube Channel Art Maker \[2021 List\]

Fortunately, you don’t need to be a renowned artist or graphic designer to get some swish YouTube art ready for your channel. With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:

#### 1\. Photoshop

Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.

New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use [web and iOS app](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker) which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.

#### 2\. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos/text/elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.

This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.

#### 3\. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/)

For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.

The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.

#### 4\. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.

Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.

#### 5\. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.

We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.

#### 6. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/)

Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.

The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.

There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design. Try some of the free versions before you jump in and pay for things, as some are actually really rather good.

## Part 7: YouTube Channel Art Dimensions Cheatsheet \[Infographic\]

Usually, a viewer won’t visit your channel page and see your channel art until after they’ve watched one of your videos. The reason they’ve clicked to see your channel is that they want to learn more about you – do you have more videos like the one they just watched? Do you post a lot? Are you worth subscribing to?

If a viewer who is on the fence about subscribing to you arrives on your channel page and sees that you haven’t bothered uploading channel art, or that you’re using something that looks sloppy, odds are they won’t subscribe. This ‘Channel Art Cheat Sheet’ will help ensure you aren’t losing potential subscribers.

### Part 1: What is YouTube channel art?

YouTube channel art includes thumbnails, banners, watermarks, and icons. Thumbnails will help viewers decide to watch your videos, and a personalized banner will tell people who you are and what your vlog is about. Watermarks both label your work as yours and protect it from theft. Your icon is the avatar you will use to communicate with your subscribers. You can totally change the look and feel of the page and the changes will carry forwards for the page display on all platforms. However, the elements might look slightly different on desktops, mobile devices, and TV screens.

#### 1. Banner

A banner sits at the top of your channel, welcoming viewers to your videos and promoting your brand. Having your brand front and center here is a great plan, as it gives people confidence in who they are watching, as well as raising your brand profile on the platform.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\.  Watermark

Watermarking your videos, banner and other content you produce can help protect your hard work. Sharing should be encouraged on YouTube, but you should absolutely get the credit for your content. A watermark ensures your brand is being acknowledged whenever someone hits the share button.

#### 3\.  Thumbnail

Developing unique thumbnails can really encourage more video views. Rather than just using a still from your actual video, you can create unique art to accompany each upload, describing what’s within the video and motivating people to watch.

**File Size:** 2MB or smaller

#### 4\.  Icon or logo

If you’re building a brand on YouTube, you should absolutely have a recognizable logo or, at least, an icon that is unique to you. This way you’ll start to be recognized whenever people stumble across your footage, even if it’s on another platform such as Facebook.

**Size:** 800x800px recommended. Can be square or round, but must render to 98x98px.

**Format:** JPG, GIF (no animated GIFs), BMP, PNG

**Do:**

**\-** Use a close up of your face (if you want a custom URL: only channels that use photos as icons qualify)

**\-** Use a simple logo (if that’s more on-brand for you)

**Don’t:**

**\-** Use a full-body picture (it won’t look good shrunk down)

**\-** Use a picture of a celebrity or an image that falls under someone else’s copyright

**How to Upload a YouTube Profile Picture / Icon**

Go to **My Channel**, hover over your existing channel icon, and click the **edit icon** (looks like a pencil). Then, click **Edit**.

#### 5\.  Channel art links

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-links.jpg)

Adding links to your YouTube channel is a no-brainer. After all, if people love your channel, why not get them engaged on your social networks and website too? Adding links is easy in the Creator Studio, and you can choose to have links overlaid on your channel art too.

#### 7\. [YouTube End Screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) / [Outros](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Length:** 5-20 seconds

**Placement:** the last 5-20 seconds of your video

Your video must be at least 25 seconds in order to add an end screen.

#### **Do:**

**\-** Link to at least 1 video or playlist

**\-** Prompt viewers to subscribe

**\-** Include social icons and handles so people can find you

**Don’t:**

**\-** Overcrowd the screen with options (it makes people less likely to click anything)

### Part 2: YouTube Channel Art Dimensions & Image Size Checklist

![YouTube channel art dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-dimension.jpg)

Getting the sizing of your channel art right is crucial. If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:

* The file size must not exceed 6MB
* The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels
* The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels
* The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels

**The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:**

* Mobile:1546px \* 423px
* Tablet :1855px \* 423px
* Desktop:2560px \* 423px
* TV:2560px \* 1440px

You see, YouTube channel art 2560\*1440 px is ideal for TV devices. If you’re not sure about the width and height of the channel art image, you can download the [Channel Art Templates from YouTube Official Site](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en) to check.

Keeping in mind people will access your channel on a variety of screen sizes, you’re going to need to design channel art that fits within these proportions and displays correctly no matter how it’s viewed. Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.

### Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?

If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial. Rather than simply having a place to upload some videos, your YouTube channel can become a powerful marketing tool for promoting your brand and values.

According to research, we are a highly visual species. 65 percent of people learn better visually, and when you’re thinking about retaining information, 90 percent of what we store in our brains is visual information. By presenting your viewers with visual content, you’re helping them take it in, retain it better and remember you for the future.

### Part 4: Tips for Making Channel Art

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-tips.jpg)

#### 1\. Tips for Making Thumbnails

A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.

One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.

If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.

#### 2\. Tips for Making Watermarks

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

#### 3\. Tips for Making Icons

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

### Part 5: Best Free & Paid YouTube Channel Art Maker \[2021 List\]

Fortunately, you don’t need to be a renowned artist or graphic designer to get some swish YouTube art ready for your channel. With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:

#### 1\. Photoshop

Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.

New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use [web and iOS app](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker) which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.

#### 2\. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos/text/elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.

This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.

#### 3\. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/)

For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.

The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.

#### 4\. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.

Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.

#### 5\. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.

We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.

#### 6. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/)

Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.

The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.

There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design. Try some of the free versions before you jump in and pay for things, as some are actually really rather good.

### Part 4: Tips for Making Channel Art

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-tips.jpg)

#### 1\. Tips for Making Thumbnails

A thumbnail is an image that represents your video in YouTube’s search results. There are things you can do with your thumbnail that will make it more likely to get clicked on. Always upload your own thumbnail rather than relying on the one YouTube automatically chooses, and make sure the thumbnail you use is related to the content of your video.

One of the most important things to remember is that thumbnails are small. It is better if there is not a lot going on in them because details will be hard to see. If there is any text in your thumbnail make sure it is huge so that people can still read it once it has been shrunken down.

If you are making a thumbnail for a vlog entry then choose a shot that has you in it, particularly one where you are not too far away from the camera. It is also a good idea if the thumbnails for your vlog entries all look similar so it is easy for people browsing to recognize which videos are yours.

#### 2\. Tips for Making Watermarks

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

#### 3\. Tips for Making Icons

Watermarks work best when they are small and transparent so they do not distract viewers from your videos. If your watermark is colored, there should not be more than one or two colors. Unlike the full version of your logo, you do not want your watermark to be overly eye-catching.

### Part 5: Best Free & Paid YouTube Channel Art Maker \[2021 List\]

Fortunately, you don’t need to be a renowned artist or graphic designer to get some swish YouTube art ready for your channel. With some of the easy-to-use, powerful tools that are available out there, you can make some beautiful, professional-looking channel art in no time at all. Here are six of our favorite tools for creating amazing youtube channel art:

#### 1\. Photoshop

Produced by Adobe, Photoshop has been leading the way in professional design software for many years. When it comes to creating logos, banners, editing photos and more, nothing really comes close to the power of this software. While the professional version of Photoshop can set you back several hundreds of dollars, Photoshop Elements is much more affordable at around the $100 mark, and has enough functionality to do most things you’d need for your channel art.

New from Adobe is Adobe Spark Post, a free-to-use [web and iOS app](https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker) which has been specifically designed to help you create beautiful channel art. Although it can only provide basic channel art without much in the way of editing tools, if you’re new to graphic design and want a free, user-friendly way to create your art, this could be worth considering.

#### 2\. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

![YouTube channel art maker - PixStudio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-tools-to-create-channel-art.jpg)

Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. This online platform provides a wonderful creative design solution for you. Just through drag and drop templates, and then use photos/text/elements to design. After the simple and fast design, One-Click to download your creations, and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.

This online platform empowers anyone to create a beautiful design within a few steps. No professional skills required! By simply dragging and dropping the creative elements and templates, you are capable to release your imagination and convert it to stunning artwork.

#### 3\. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/)

For a good, user-friendly way to create professional-looking YouTube channel art, Fotor is a pretty solid choice. Using a simple drag and drop interface, users can create a unique channel banner using preset designs or even uploading their own artwork.

The developers of Fotor have built in a bespoke banner maker, preset to the exact size required for YouTube channel art. This makes it easier than ever to ensure you develop excellent channel art which will display correctly on any device. Editing is limited, so advanced designers will probably find it all a bit too simplistic, but for the man on the street, this is a perfect choice.

#### 4\. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

Canva really stands out from the competition for the number of customizable design elements present on the website. From shapes to backgrounds, images to text, there are thousands of awesome, professional-looking elements to choose from to create your unique channel art.

Similar to Fotor, those who know what they’re doing in the design field will find it lacking in functionality, and there’s an irritating glitch where you can’t stretch more than one image to the ends of the canvas. Watch out for premium design elements too, as lots require payment, although usually not more than a dollar or two.

#### 5\. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

For a good middle ground between expensive but powerful Photoshop and free but limited options like Canva and Fotor, PicMonkey is a great solution. It has plenty of design functionality, from working with layers to performing tasks like blending, and you can free draw and erase parts of your image too.

We found PicMonkey capable of pretty much everything you’d need to create a professional YouTube banner, and it’s a fair bit more user friendly than Photoshop too. It’s not free, but at a cost of $7.99 per month, it’s pretty affordable for what you get.

#### 6. [Snappa](https://snappa.com/)

Another web-based freemium service, Snappa has the added advantage of coming pre-loaded with all the dimensions of popular social channel’s banners, profile images and more, including YouTube. That means you can work on your channel art directly, seeing clearly which parts will be displayed on what devices.

The drawback to this particular platform is the sheer volume of stock images already on the site. There are some nice ones, but due to the lack of organization you need to scroll through quite a few mediocre options to find them. There’s also a fairly ungenerous limit on how many items you can create and save without upgrading, but the pro version is fairly affordable at just $10 a month.

There are many other services out there to help you create your YouTube channel art and what’s best for you will depend on the type of channel art you’re looking to create, as well as your own abilities with graphic design. Try some of the free versions before you jump in and pay for things, as some are actually really rather good.

## Part 7: YouTube Channel Art Dimensions Cheatsheet \[Infographic\]

Usually, a viewer won’t visit your channel page and see your channel art until after they’ve watched one of your videos.

### Part 1: What is YouTube channel art?

YouTube channel art includes thumbnails, banners, watermarks, and icons. Thumbnails will help viewers decide to watch your videos, and a personalized banner will tell people who you are and what your vlog is about. Watermarks both label your work as yours and protect it from theft. Your icon is the avatar you will use to communicate with your subscribers. You can totally change the look and feel of the page and the changes will carry forwards for the page display on all platforms. However, the elements might look slightly different on desktops, mobile devices, and TV screens.

#### 1. Banner

A banner sits at the top of your channel, welcoming viewers to your videos and promoting your brand. Having your brand front and center here is a great plan, as it gives people confidence in who they are watching, as well as raising your brand profile on the platform.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Size**: 2560x1440px recommended. Cannot be smaller than 2048x1152px.

**Safe Area for All Devices**: 1546x423px

**File Size**: 6MB or smaller

**Do:**

\- Make sure all your text is in the safe area

\- Include channel information like what kinds of videos you make and your upload days

\- Add social media links

**Don’t:**

\- Use a font or font color that’s hard to read at a glance

\- Put a busy background or photo directly behind your text (put a solid background in-between)

 **How to Upload a YouTube Banner / Channel Art**

Go to My Channel and select Add channel art near the top of the screen (if this is the first time), or hover over your existing channel art to make the edit icon show up.

#### 2\.  Watermark

Watermarking your videos, banner and other content you produce can help protect your hard work. Sharing should be encouraged on YouTube, but you should absolutely get the credit for your content. A watermark ensures your brand is being acknowledged whenever someone hits the share button.

#### 3\.  Thumbnail

Developing unique thumbnails can really encourage more video views. Rather than just using a still from your actual video, you can create unique art to accompany each upload, describing what’s within the video and motivating people to watch.

**Size:** 1289x720px recommended. Width cannot be less than 640px.

**File Size:** 2MB or smaller

**Format:** .JPG, .GIF (no moving GIFS), .BMP, .PNG

**Do:**

**\-** Use colors that stand out

**\-**  Have a consistent format (all your thumbnails should have the same basic layout)

**\-** Include your face (or a character’s face, if you’re a gamer)

**\-** Show viewers what your video is about

**Don’t:**

**\-** Include anything sexually suggestive or violent.

**\-** Write more than 3 words or use a small font

**How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail**

In the screen right after you’ve uploaded a video (in your Creator Studio), select **Custom thumbnail** under **Video thumbnails** after you upload a video.

OR

Select **Edit** next to your video in the **Video Manager/Creator Studio**. In the preview screen, click **Custom thumbnail**.

#### 4\.  Icon or logo

If you’re building a brand on YouTube, you should absolutely have a recognizable logo or, at least, an icon that is unique to you. This way you’ll start to be recognized whenever people stumble across your footage, even if it’s on another platform such as Facebook.

**Size:** 800x800px recommended. Can be square or round, but must render to 98x98px.

**Format:** JPG, GIF (no animated GIFs), BMP, PNG

**Do:**

**\-** Use a close up of your face (if you want a custom URL: only channels that use photos as icons qualify)

**\-** Use a simple logo (if that’s more on-brand for you)

**Don’t:**

**\-** Use a full-body picture (it won’t look good shrunk down)

**\-** Use a picture of a celebrity or an image that falls under someone else’s copyright

**How to Upload a YouTube Profile Picture / Icon**

Go to **My Channel**, hover over your existing channel icon, and click the **edit icon** (looks like a pencil). Then, click **Edit**.

#### 5\.  Channel art links

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-links.jpg)

Adding links to your YouTube channel is a no-brainer. After all, if people love your channel, why not get them engaged on your social networks and website too? Adding links is easy in the Creator Studio, and you can choose to have links overlaid on your channel art too.

#### 6\.  YouTube Intros

**Placement:** within the first 30 seconds of your video.

**Do:**

**\-** Use music

**\-**  Include colors and images that match your personal brand

**\-** Include the name of your channel

**Don’t:**

**\-**  Make it longer than 10 seconds

**How to Add a YouTube Intro**

Add your intro before you upload using your video editing software. It’s best to create it in a separate project and export it as a clip you can re-use in all your videos. Click here to download some [free intros](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7\. [YouTube End Screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) / [Outros](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Length:** 5-20 seconds

**Placement:** the last 5-20 seconds of your video

Your video must be at least 25 seconds in order to add an end screen.

#### **Do:**

**\-** Link to at least 1 video or playlist

**\-** Prompt viewers to subscribe

**\-** Include social icons and handles so people can find you

**Don’t:**

**\-** Overcrowd the screen with options (it makes people less likely to click anything)

### Part 2: YouTube Channel Art Dimensions & Image Size Checklist

![YouTube channel art dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-dimension.jpg)

Getting the sizing of your channel art right is crucial. If you don’t plan this from the start, then all the effort you put into designing your channel art will be wasted, as it will either not display properly or will just look terrible. YouTube has provided these guidelines for channel art designs:

* The file size must not exceed 6MB
* The image should ideally be 2560 x 1440 pixels
* The minimum image size is 2048 x 1152 pixels
* The maximum width is 2560 x 423 pixels

**The ideal dimensions for different devices are listed below:**

* Mobile:1546px \* 423px
* Tablet :1855px \* 423px
* Desktop:2560px \* 423px
* TV:2560px \* 1440px

You see, YouTube channel art 2560\*1440 px is ideal for TV devices. If you’re not sure about the width and height of the channel art image, you can download the [Channel Art Templates from YouTube Official Site](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en) to check.

Keeping in mind people will access your channel on a variety of screen sizes, you’re going to need to design channel art that fits within these proportions and displays correctly no matter how it’s viewed. Use the ‘safe area’ displayed on YouTube to ensure your logo and branding is correct on every screen size.

### Part 3: Why should you care about channel art?

If you’re wondering if you should really be bothered about channel art, the answer is you absolutely should. Channel art is all about branding, and in today’s cluttered web world, having a strong, recognizable brand is crucial. Rather than simply having a place to upload some videos, your YouTube channel can become a powerful marketing tool for promoting your brand and values.

According to research, we are a highly visual species. 65 percent of people learn better visually, and when you’re thinking about retaining information, 90 percent of what we store in our brains is visual information. By presenting your viewers with visual content, you’re helping them take it in, retain it better and remember you for the future.
