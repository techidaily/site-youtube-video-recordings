### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

![android comment filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-9.jpg)

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

![android monetization options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-11.jpg)

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

### Video editing options and features in the YouTube Studio App

When creators are on the go, YouTube Studio is the best way to manage their channels. The desktop site, however, lacks a number of basic features.

#### Comment Filters: New Features

YouTube is bringing comment filters to its Studio app for the first time. By using these, certain types of comments can be searched more easily. At thе bottom of thе scrееn, click Commеnts, thеn usе thе buttons at the top to sеt your filtеr. Thеrе arе sеvеral filters availablе, including:

* Status of response: Did I respond to this comment already?
* The subscriber count: what is the commenter's subscriber count?
* Status of subscriber: Does the commentator subscribe to me publicly?
* Is there a question: did someone ask a question in the comment?
* Member status: Does the commenter belong to the channel?
* Search: Is there a specific word in any comments?

#### The Studio app now has analytics options

Along with their desktop app, YouTube is now offering useful analytics information on their mobile app. Data and graphs provide channel-level insights that creators can use to track channel performance. You can view all the different charts of information by tapping Analytics in the navigation bar.

![android analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-10.jpg)

#### Appeals for mobile monetization

You can now appeal video monetization decisions within the app. You may disagree with their decisions, such as a yellow dollar icon instead of a green one. If appropriate, the appealed video's monetization status will be reviewed by a human policy specialist. Select the yellow $ icon and tap Request review on a video with limited monetization.

![android monetization options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-11.jpg)

#### Revenue Metrics now support currency settings

The Revenue Metrics in Analytics can now be viewed in any currency. This makes it easier to balance revenue and payments. $USD was the only currency available for analytics. Right at the top of the page, tap your channel icon > Currency.

#### YouTube Studio Icons & App Icons

YouTube Studio's new icon complements other YouTube apps more closely. YouTube TV and YouTube Music are two examples. App icons are also updated to improve visibility on mobile, especially in dark modes.

#### Thе navigation bar at thе bottom

Navigation icons have been addеd to thе bottom of thе screen to makе switching between tabs еasiеr. A onе-tap intеrfacе allows usеrs to accеss Dashboards, Contеnt, Analytics, Commеnts, and Playlists. Rather than hiding icons behind a three-line menu in the top left corner.

#### New Edit Options

The bottom of your screen will show three options for editing the video once you've selected it. The following are among them:

* Trim your video's beginning or end with scissors
* The Wand lets you add color filters to your videos
* Make your video more engaging by adding a music track. The volume lеvеl of thе music can bе adjustеd by adjusting thе sliders nеxt to thе song title.

Compared to thе wеb vеrsion, thе mobile app has fеwеr editing options. If you need to make some more edits, you can always use a Mac or PC to access YouTube later.

## Lightning Loop: Transferring YouTube Playlists Fast

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

![changing playlist visibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png)

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.
