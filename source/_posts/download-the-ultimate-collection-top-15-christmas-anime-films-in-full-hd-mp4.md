![NO.1 Anime Christmas - Shokugeki no Souma](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/food-wars-season-2-anime-christmas-5kplayer.jpg) 

**Recommend 1 !! 2016 Anime Christmas ![best Christmas Anime](https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/5kp-thumup-zjy.png)** 
**[Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara (Food Wars! The Second Plate, 食戟のソーマ 弍ノ皿)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32282/Shokugeki%5Fno%5FSouma%5F%5FNi%5Fno%5FSara)**  
Rate: 8.49 | Finished | 13 episodes 24 min each|   
 More than the best 2016 anime Christmas for this list, Food Wars! The Second Plate is probably the titular series throughout the year. As the ambitious protagonist Souma strives to be a masterchef by way of challenging the just-as-talented rivals: Alice Nakiri, etc, the series unfolds with countless humors & foodgasm that makes you drool just by looking at the pictures. The reason we consider Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara as suitable for Holiday season is that the storytelling goes way more intensive than its prequel - Unlike season 1 in 2015 with a complete buildup of 25 episodes, this installment dives into the main course of culinary tournament with 13 episodes with the main meat of the show. Nothing compares spending X-mas with gourment & eye candy like this!

Natsuki was almost desperate when his girlfriend chose the very Christmas Eve to break up with hime, still in tears, another fairy-like young girl dressed in Santa Claus suit came over and handed to him soft-n-dry tissues, which is the sign of a relationship's outset.
