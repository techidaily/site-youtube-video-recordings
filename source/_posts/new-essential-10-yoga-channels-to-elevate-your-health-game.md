## How do you pick the best yoga channel on YouTube for you?

With so many yoga videos accessible on YouTube, it can be difficult to know where to begin and which ones would be the greatest fit for you. However, a simple place to start is to look up keywords that you associate with yoga. If you're new to yoga, check for 'beginning classes' or 'introduction to yoga,' for example." SELF speaks with Carlye Cole, a certified yoga teacher who specializes in Hatha, vinyasa, yin yoga, and meditation.

It's also a good idea to brush up on some yoga terminology so you know what each class has to offer. There are many various kinds of yoga, from vinyasa to Hatha to yin, and each practice is exceptionally distinct. That's why, according to Freeman, doing some study on some of the YouTube instructors that came up in your initial search can be beneficial.

It would be best if you began with a shorter session once you've thought of a few alternatives. This will give you a sense of the teacher's style and the type of material they provide. "As you sample the channels and narrow down which ones resonate with you, you can extend the time."

Moreover, it's also beneficial to look for classes where the teachers offer numerous versions for each posture so that you may discover a shape that works for you rather than forcing your body into one certain shape.

## How do you pick the best yoga channel on YouTube for you?

With so many yoga videos accessible on YouTube, it can be difficult to know where to begin and which ones would be the greatest fit for you. However, a simple place to start is to look up keywords that you associate with yoga. If you're new to yoga, check for 'beginning classes' or 'introduction to yoga,' for example." SELF speaks with Carlye Cole, a certified yoga teacher who specializes in Hatha, vinyasa, yin yoga, and meditation.

It's also a good idea to brush up on some yoga terminology so you know what each class has to offer. There are many various kinds of yoga, from vinyasa to Hatha to yin, and each practice is exceptionally distinct. That's why, according to Freeman, doing some study on some of the YouTube instructors that came up in your initial search can be beneficial.

It would be best if you began with a shorter session once you've thought of a few alternatives. This will give you a sense of the teacher's style and the type of material they provide. "As you sample the channels and narrow down which ones resonate with you, you can extend the time."

Moreover, it's also beneficial to look for classes where the teachers offer numerous versions for each posture so that you may discover a shape that works for you rather than forcing your body into one certain shape.

![choose a yoga youtube channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-yoga-youtuber-2.jpg)
