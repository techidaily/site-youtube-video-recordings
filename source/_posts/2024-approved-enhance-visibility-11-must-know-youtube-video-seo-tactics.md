![youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png)

When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.

For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.

#### 2\. Use a Good Video Title

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - video title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png)

The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it's what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you'll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.

#### 3\. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website

Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.

#### 4\. Add Tags To The Video Description

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - add tags to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-3.png)

When you upload your video, remember to add tags to the "About" section of the page. You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.

When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.

#### 5\. Edit The Filename

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - edit the file name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png)

The filename of your video, or the "video URL," can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.

#### 6\. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png)

Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video's ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### 7\. Select Video Category

![youtube seo tips - select video category](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png)

When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube's algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.

#### 8\. Use a Compelling Thumbnail

![youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png)

Make sure you use [the right YouTube video thumbnail image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.

Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.

Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.

#### 9\. Make High-Quality Longer

Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.

![youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png)

When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.

For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.

#### 2\. Use a Good Video Title

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - video title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png)

The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it's what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you'll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.

#### 3\. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website

Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.

#### 4\. Add Tags To The Video Description

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<span id="1997795">
					<video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"
           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"
           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">

	<div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - add tags to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-3.png)

When you upload your video, remember to add tags to the "About" section of the page. You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.

When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.

#### 5\. Edit The Filename

![youtube seo tips - edit the file name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png)

The filename of your video, or the "video URL," can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.

#### 6\. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png)

Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video's ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### 7\. Select Video Category

![youtube seo tips - select video category](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png)

When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube's algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.

#### 8\. Use a Compelling Thumbnail

![youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png)

Make sure you use [the right YouTube video thumbnail image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.

Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.

Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.

#### 9\. Make High-Quality Longer

Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.
