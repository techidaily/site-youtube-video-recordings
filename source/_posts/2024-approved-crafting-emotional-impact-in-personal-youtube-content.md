YouTube is a great platform you can use not only to share your gifts and talents with the world but also to share who you are as a person. No matter how many followers you may currently have, you are an amazing person just as you are with a unique story. Here are ten [YouTube video ideas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to share your personal story.

* [Channel Trailer](#one)
* [My YouTube Story](#two)
* [Draw My Life](#three)
* [Snapchat/Instagram Stories Q&A](#four)
* [Never Have I Ever Q&A](#five)
* [Get Ready With me Q&A](#six)
* [My Depression/Anxiety or Mental Health Story](#seven)
* [Narrated Autobiopic](#eight)
* [25 Facts About Me](#nine)
* [YouTube Live/Webinar](#ten)

### 1\.  Channel Trailer

Before posting any videos on your channel, it can be a great idea to [create a “Channel Trailer”](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) summarizing who you are and what your channel is all about.

YouTuber Shameless Maya does an excellent job of this. She created a visually appealing and engaging 1-2 minute channel trailer that explains exactly what her channel is all about. Feel free to be as creative as you want to be.

###  2\.  My YouTube Story

On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?

### 3\.  Draw My Life

“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.

### 4\.  Snapchat/Instagram Stories Q&A

Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q & A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.

### 5\.  Never Have I Ever Q & A

Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q & A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.

### 6\.  Get Ready With Me Q & A

Get ready with me Q & As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I'm doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1\. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.

### 7\.  My Depression/Anxiety or Mental Health Story

Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.

### 8\.  Narrated Autobiopic

Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.

### 9\.  25 Facts About Me Tag

This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.

### 10\.  YouTube Live/Webinar

YouTube live videos are probably the best ways to interact and share your story with viewers. Viewers can ask questions on the spot. YouTuber Roberto Blake shares great live videos on how to improve your videos and things he’s learned through personal experience.

Custom Thumbnail is a tool through which the viewers can understand everything about a video. It tells the viewers what to expect from a video, what not to expect, and what the video is all about. no matter if you create amazing content, if the thumbnail is not good enough to covey that to the viewers, all your hard work will be of no use and will not bring any good to your channel and its growth. According to [Google](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72431),90% of best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. It shows the importance of custom thumbnails.

## Best Practice From Experiences

Now, since we know the importance of having a custom thumbnail, it is important to know how to make a thumbnail for Youtube look perfect, appealing, and eye-catching at the same time. There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.

7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.

1. #### Show your face

In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?

![comparison-of-showing-face-or-not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png)

1. #### Use Simple Fonts

With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don't use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.

![simple-fonts-recommended](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png)

1. #### Use Phrases, not sentence

If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/), more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices.

## Best Practice From Experiences

Now, since we know the importance of having a custom thumbnail, it is important to know how to make a thumbnail for Youtube look perfect, appealing, and eye-catching at the same time. There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.

7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.

1. #### Show your face

In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?

![comparison-of-showing-face-or-not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png)

1. #### Use Simple Fonts

With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don't use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.

![simple-fonts-recommended](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png)

1. #### Use Phrases, not sentence

If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/), more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.

Whether you want to remove the background of your image or add attractive titles to it, Filmora X has got you covered.

1. #### Avoid clickbait and irrelevant pics and title

It is one of the old tricks that **so many people on Youtube us**e. **It undoubtedly** brings you clicks and more views, but once the viewer realizes that you have used irrelevant pictures or texts to attract them**. I**n reality, your video doesn't contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don't use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term. Only use the text and images that are relevant to your content and stick to that.

1. #### Choose your preview window wisely

Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don't click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That's why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.

## Best Practice From Experiences

Now, since we know the importance of having a custom thumbnail, it is important to know how to make a thumbnail for Youtube look perfect, appealing, and eye-catching at the same time. There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.

7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.

1. #### Show your face

In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?

![comparison-of-showing-face-or-not](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png)

1. #### Use Simple Fonts

With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don't use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.

![simple-fonts-recommended](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png)

1. #### Use Phrases, not sentence

If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/), more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.

![piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png)

![use-phrases-not-sentences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg)

1. #### Put every stuff on left side

When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, "Watch Later" and "Add to Queue," located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.

![put-stuff-on-left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg)

1. #### Have a unique and Consistent style

Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style. Following the same style for all your Youtube thumbnails will make your channel look unique and all your videos identical. It will be easy for viewers to identify your videos when they see them. It gives your channel a touch of its unique brand.

![unique-and-consistent-style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unique-and-consistent-style.png)

1. #### Use elements to grab the attention

To make your Youtube thumbnail more appealing to the viewers, add circles and arrows to grab viewers' attention to something very important in the video. It will increase the curiosity in the viewers and make them click your videos to learn more.

![use-elements-to-grab-attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-elements-to-grab-attention.jpg)
