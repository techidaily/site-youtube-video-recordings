## Free Download StupidVideos Videos with Tubeoffline:

Tubeoffline is a website, similar to Keepvid, which can download StupidVideos videos. 

_How does it work?_  
You'll have to get the Right URL in the Sample Format first, and then paste it into the generating box to generate a link for downloading.  
_Defects_:   
\*Endless ads: After every click on the site, an ad follows to open in a new tab, and you'll have to close them one by one before heading to the target webpage, which is quite annoying.   
\*Cross domain policy restrictions: This means that some videos provided in StupidVideos cannot be downloaded through tubeoffline due to these restrictions.  
\*Safety: There's barely any likelihood that the site can be isolated from ads according to how it functions. No guarantees to safety and cleanness at all.
