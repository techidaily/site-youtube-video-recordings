## Download TikTok Videos to MP4 No Watermark

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last updated: August 25, 2020 | 3 Min Read_

**TikTok video download** is always a good method to save your favorite videos when you swipe up TikTok short videos uploaded by others. And now, it even seems an urgent task to save the TikTok videos so as to keep all videos including yours safe as wars between TikTok and Trump government is on fire. 

After TikTok app had been banned in India, President Donald Trump on August 6 said that he would ban TikTok app in the USA after September 15 if TikTok is not sold by its Chinese-owned parent company to a US buyer. On August 23, TikTok said it will sue Trump Administration over app ban. Though Microsoft and Oracle are in talks to acquire TikTok app to prevent the shutdown of TikTok in America, the consequence is still to be determined. If TikTok is banned in the United States, the ban decision may also happen in the UK and Australia.

So, for anyone who is addicted to TikTok app, you’d better download your own TikTok videos and other favorites as soon as possible before [TikTok is not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

This is the most straightforward way to save TikTok videos, but you have to know the downloaded video will have a giant TikTok logo watermark.

If you agree others to download your videos, you can go to "Privacy and settings" of your TikTok account on your Android phone > "Privacy and Safety" > "Allow your videos to be downloaded".
