For most people, vlogging is not something that comes naturally. Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.

When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.

## **1\. Be Authentic**

People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.

Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.

There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.

Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **2\. Tell A Story**

A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.

When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.

Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.

Take a look at this example from [Tiffany Alvord](https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord) and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.

## **3\. Surprise and Delight Your Audience**

There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is [surprising, yet inevitable](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html).

The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.

The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat's bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **4\. Be Inviting**

A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.

Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.

The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.

## **5\. Compose the Shot**

Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.

In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.

The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn [the basics of video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Check out this example from [Rosanna Pansino](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q), where she gives a tour of her bedroom.

 The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.

## **6\. Be Prepared**

While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.

Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…

Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.

Take a look at [Ashley Nichole](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w) in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.

## **7\. Be Expressive**

Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.

If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.

Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.

Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out [Emma Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg), if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.

## **8\. Stay Organized**

The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.

This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.

Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.

Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.

The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.
  
There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.

Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are [fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Take a look at some of the [first videos from popular YouTubers](http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/)and you can see that everyone had a starting point.

The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.

I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.

The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn [the basics of video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Check out this example from [Rosanna Pansino](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q), where she gives a tour of her bedroom.

 The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.

## **6\. Be Prepared**

While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.

Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…

Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.

Take a look at [Ashley Nichole](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w) in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.

## **7\. Be Expressive**

Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.

If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.

Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.

Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out [Emma Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg), if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.

## **8\. Stay Organized**

The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.

This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.

Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.

Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.

The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.
  
There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.

Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are [fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Take a look at some of the [first videos from popular YouTubers](http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/)and you can see that everyone had a starting point.

For most people, vlogging is not something that comes naturally. Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.

When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **1\. Be Authentic**

People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.

Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.

There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.

Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.

## **2\. Tell A Story**

A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.

When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.

Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.

Take a look at this example from [Tiffany Alvord](https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord) and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.

## **3\. Surprise and Delight Your Audience**

There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is [surprising, yet inevitable](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html).

The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.

The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat's bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.

## **4\. Be Inviting**

A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.

Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.

The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.

## **5\. Compose the Shot**

Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.

In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.

The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn [the basics of video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…

Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.

Take a look at [Ashley Nichole](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w) in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.

## What Is a DJ Template Video Download?

DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.

There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:

* **Pre-Designed Visuals:** These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.
* **Customizable Elements:** You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event's theme.
* **Format and Compatibility:** They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?

Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.

With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.

After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.

## How to Customize Templates for a Unique Experience?

The way you customize these templates is by editing them in a video editor of your choice after downloading them. However, not all templates are customizable.

In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.

This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.

You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.

## Technical Considerations

Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.

So, consider the following:

##### 1\. Video Resolution and Quality

Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.

Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.

##### 2\. Format Compatibility

Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.

Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.

##### 3\. Performance and Playback

The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.

If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.

##### 4\. Audio Sync

Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.

You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.

## Legal Aspects and Copyright

This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.

Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:

* **Read the Fine Print**: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.
* **Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use**: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.
* **Attribution Requirements**: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.
* **Modifications and Derivative Works**: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.

## What Is a DJ Template Video Download?

DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.

There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:

* **Pre-Designed Visuals:** These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.
* **Customizable Elements:** You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event's theme.
* **Format and Compatibility:** They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.

## Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?

Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.

With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.

After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.

## How to Customize Templates for a Unique Experience?

The way you customize these templates is by editing them in a video editor of your choice after downloading them. However, not all templates are customizable.

In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.

This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.

You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.

## Technical Considerations

Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.

So, consider the following:

##### 1\. Video Resolution and Quality

Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.

Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.

##### 2\. Format Compatibility

Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.

Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.

##### 3\. Performance and Playback

The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.

If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.

##### 4\. Audio Sync

Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.

You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.
