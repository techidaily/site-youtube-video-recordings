## Part 1: How to See Your YouTube Subscribers List?

Finding out who your subscribers are on YouTube is a simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

1\. In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel's home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.

![YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg)

You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.

2\. Once the Creator Studio opens, you'll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.

3\. You'll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.

![YouTube Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-community-create-studio.jpg)

4\. Select the Subscribers option from the menu and wait for the list of the subscribers to appear on your screen. You'll be able to see a list of YouTube users that have subscribed to your channel.

![Finding YouTube Subscribers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg)

Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.

If you would like to go through a more detailed tutorial about how to see who your subscribers are, click [here and learn each step of this simple process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKndwFejMow)

If you’re using YouTube Studio, you can go to the **Recent subscribers** card on the Dashboard, and then click **SEE ALL** to check the list of the recent subscribers.

![ See YouTube Subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-youtube-studio.jpg)

## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)

YouTube TV has a distinctive set of features that make it incredibly enticing — so much so that it is comfortably among the top three live TV providers in the United States in terms of paid subscribers. This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.

In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable. You can watch YouTube TV on almost any current gadget. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been heavily marketing it over the last few years hasn't hurt either.

A lot is going on with YouTube TV, and it's only gotten better with time.

## What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?

YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It's an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.

When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.

Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you'll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.

![youtube tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-1.jpg)

## How to Watch YouTube TV?

#### Using a computer

1. Ensure that your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as Chromecast.
2. Open your favorite browser and navigate to tv.youtube.com.

#### Using a mobile device

1. Connect your mobile device or PC to the same Wi-Fi network as your streaming device.
2. On your mobile device, open YouTube TV.

![what is youtube tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-2.jpg)

## Is Youtube Tv A Good Investment?

YouTube TV is the premium live TV service to choose from because it has the best channel selection and an unlimited DVR. YouTube TV has proven to be one of the greatest live TV streaming services, with an excellent channel selection and an unrivaled user experience, since its introduction in 2017.

While the price has nearly risen since then, it is still a better option than any of its premium competitors, including Hulu Plus Live TV, FuboTV, and DirecTV Stream. Aside from channels, YouTube TV is simple to use, stylish, and fast on a range of TV and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is the best in the business, with unlimited storage and nearly all of the features of a hardware DVR like TiVo.

#### What can you get from YouTube TV?

YouTube TV is distinct from YouTube, the free video site with over 2 billion monthly users. With live channels and on-demand programmers available on a variety of devices, YouTube TV offers a similar experience to cable television. It is compatible with Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and various other smart TVs, phones, tablets, and web browsers.

#### Which networks are supported by Youtube TV?

YouTube TV allows you to watch live and local sports, news, and entertainment from more than 70 channels, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, HGTV, TNT, and others. YouTube TV also offers local and regional content, providing complete local network coverage in over 98 percent of US TV households. YouTube TV is an online streaming service that allows customers to watch live television on computers, phones, and other compatible devices. It requires a high-speed internet connection and is a practical alternative to cable television for those wishing to cut the cord.

YouTube TV offers a variety of paid add-on channels. These are channels that need a fee in addition to the regular YouTube TV fee. However, this is the greatest method for accessing uncut and unedited movies on YouTube TV.

The following are among the premium add-on channels available on YouTube TV:
