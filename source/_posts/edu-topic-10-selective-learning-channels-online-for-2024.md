There is no better time for singers, actors, and content creators to join TikTok. With over a billion downloads, TikTok is now more influential than ever. Here, you can consider all TikTok users to be prospective audiences or followers. Videos go viral every day, and a substantial portion of them come from a single source: TikTok.

The massively popular short-video app is the latest craze, with individuals from all over the world using it to watch and produce content. Instagram stars, YouTube stars, and even real-life movie stars have switched to this platform, so what's stopping you? It has so much to offer. Both seem to work in a connected way as Tiktok stars are seen converting videos from **YouTube to TikTok.**

#### In this article

01 [How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?](#part1)

02 [ How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? \[3 ways\] ](#part2)

## Part 1: How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok. Even though Tiktok's operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app 'VINE' was shut down back in 2016.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let's look at your options of connecting videos from **YouTube to TikTok** and highlight h**ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.**

Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your **profile** option.

Step 2: Tap on the **edit profile** option and further select **Add YouTube to Your Profile** option.

Note: If you haven't previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the **Google login screen**.

Step 3: Click on **"Allow" option**. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.

Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not **always clickable**. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.

## Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok? \[3 ways\]

Further, we feel that differences in posting (such as formats, [aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and durations) should be accounted for when YouTube videos are converted into TikTok videos. Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.

As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.

* **Dimensions:** 1080 x 1920
* **Resolution:** 9:16 Aspect Ratio
* **File Format:**.mp4 or .mov
* **Code**:  encoded

We might have left you perplexed with all the information about **how to connect TikTok to YouTube**, but don't worry, here are a variety of apps and a step-by-step guide for posting your videos on Tiktok without any issues.

**Step 1: Copy the YouTube Video's link**

To get started, go to YouTube and search for the video you wish to convert. You can copy the link by right-clicking on YouTube's video and paste it on Kapwing directly.

Note: Alternatively, if you're already logged in, choose **Create** **New Project**. This will lead you to the Kapwing Studio, on which you can access all of Kapwing's video editing capabilities in a single location.

**Step 2: Resize YouTube video to 9:16**

Double click the video in the timeline, and then click the Crop menu on the right top corner. To convert a YouTube video to TikTok, click the 9:16 option to start. Or, you can move the handles in the timeline until it reaches the precise length you need.

Note: When you process your video, make sure it has a 9:16 aspect ratio so it will fit on TikTok.

**Step 3: Download & share on TikTok!**

After you've uploaded your video to the Studio, just select the **Export Video** option in the upper right corner to save your video and share it on TikTok.

### 2\. Kamua

On TikTok, content always takes precedence. One strategy to grow your TikTok audience is to convert your existing YouTube videos to post, and Kamua is the perfect tool for this! Kamua, a cloud-based video tool, allows creators to resize, crop, edit and save videos. Everything, including cutting, retouching, and repurposing of the video, is available in a single place.

Perhaps you have some daring, humorous, or legendary videos in a neglected collection that would be perfect for a TikTok trend or challenge- it's time to edit them with Kamua! Transforming Landscape films vertically into the 9:16 aspect ratio is now easier and faster than ever before with Kamua.

Step 1: Copy the YouTube Video link and paste it into the Kamua.

**Note:** You can right-click on any video on YouTube to copy the link or click on the **Share** option.

![copy paste youtube link kamua](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-paste-youtube-link-kamua.jpg)

**Step 2:** To turn on **AutoCrop**, select the Portrait (9:16) setting under the Settings menu on the left. You can also choose Remove Black Bars to resize the video.

**Note:** To preview how your videos would look on a TikTok mobile app, click the **Phone symbol** underneath the video

**Step 3:** Once done, click on the **render project** option in the below right corner to save the optimized video file. To watch the final video or to download it, click on the **Outputs** option. From here, you can watch as well as download your video.

### 3\. Use Auto Reframe Feature in [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Auto Reframe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as clear from the name, can automatically visualize and detect the video's focal point to resize or crop it in an optimal way. The Auto Reframe tool can identify a moving item in any video and rapidly trim it to multiple aspect ratios. What initially took hours, if not days, of editing may now be completed in moments with Filmora. You can also manually set the focal point in any video to adjust the aspect ratio and preferences as per your choice.

If you frequently have to upload videos to your social networking networks such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, Filmora will ease your life! We'll teach you how to utilize Filmora's Auto-Reframe option to reframe sequences for your **YouTube to TikTok videos** in the below-listed steps.

Step 1: Start by **Launching Filmora** on your device. Choose the Auto Reframe option from the starting window.

![auto reframe in filmora start window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reframe-in-filmora-start-window.jpg)

Step 2:Click on **Import Media** and select the video file you wish to convert. A separate dialogue box will open. From here, choose the **aspect ratio** and click on **Analyze**. The reframing process will start automatically.

![import video to auto reframe window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-to-auto-reframe-window.jpg)

You can choose from **five different aspect ratios**: square (1:1), vertical (9:16), standard (4:3), widescreen (16:9), and cinema (21:9). You can also adjust the **frame's dimensions** by moving the crop box.

![adjust auto reframe frames position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-auto-reframe-frames-position.jpg)

Step 3: When you're through with the adjustments and reframing, click the **Export option** to preserve your work.

![auto reframe export window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auto-reframe-export-window.jpg)

**Note:** Click Save after you enter a file name and select a destination folder. Add music, titles, effects, or transitions to improve the clip. You can move the clip to the timeline for more editing. You can share and save your video on TikTok once you have completed editing by clicking the Export option.
