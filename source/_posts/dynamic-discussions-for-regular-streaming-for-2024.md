Every genre on YouTube has its own unique challenges, but **daily vlogging** is probably the hardest thing you could take on. Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.

How do you know [what you should talk about in your vlog](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.

Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.

## Do you have a niche?

  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.

The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.

Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What are you watching/reading?

 If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch/read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.

By commenting on what you’re watching/reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.

## Snapshots of Your Day

 Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.

Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.

## Whatever You Need to Get Out

_Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like 'Party Pooper', and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day._

 Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.

It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.

Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.

## What did you learn today?

 _Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for 'Yesterday' were 'Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs'._

 You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:

 Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.

The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.

Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.

The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).

Sea monkeys can survive in space.

## EVERYTHING

You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school/work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.

 Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.

It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.

Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.

## What did you learn today?

 _Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for 'Yesterday' were 'Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs'._

 You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers. Here a few facts to get you started:

 Whales evolved from a land-based animal called a pakicetus.

The hagfish hunt by swimming into the mouth of a larger fish and eating it from the inside.

Crows live in family units, visit their aging parents, and have funerals for dead crows.

The puya chilensis is a plant that ‘eats’ sheep (sheep get stuck to it, starve, and end up as fertilizer).

Sea monkeys can survive in space.

## EVERYTHING

You could also just flick the camera on and tell the full story of your day like you’d do in a traditional daily blog. What did you have for breakfast, how was school/work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.

## The Game Plan for Creating a Hit YouTube Introduction Trailer

Do you want to know how to get more subscribers? Do you want your channel to be popular among those YouTube stars? Ok, we got you!

The most efficient and easy way to do this is by making a YouTube trailer. It will help to attract a new audience and give your channel a more artistic and pleasing approach. Scroll more to get secret tips!

## Part 1\. What is a YouTube trailer?

A YouTube trailer is a short intro video for your channel. What do you do? What is your content? It is a brief video that helps the new audience understand your channel.

In other words, a YouTube trailer is necessary for your channel. It will give the audience a better understanding of yourself and what to expect from your YouTube channel.

**Note:** also, the trailer will be visible for non-subscribed viewers who come to your channel for the first time. So as first impressions matter, they need to be creative and engaging.

##### Step1 Start with a hook

Your first step will be to find a way to engage your audience so that they will be interested in your channel or content from the very beginning. To do this, follow the below steps and enjoy the next with your audience.

![a good startup of a trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-1.gif)

**For example**

Step1 Ask a **question**.

Step2 Start with a **problem** and a solution.

Step3 Use a hypothetical situation with the words like "What if."

Step4 Open with an **exciting** **fact**

Step5 Tell a story without finishing it.

The trick here is to get the viewers' attention within 5 seconds, so they're interested in your channel from the beginning. Also, it intrigues them to keep watching.

##### Step2 Tell a little about yourself

Make a short intro, depending on the content and your presence on the screen. Again, developing a friendly relationship between the viewers and yourself is beneficial.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![self-introduction example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-2.gif)

You can add a quick introduction about yourself and your backstory. It will create a sense of personal attachment to the channel and help you engage better with the audience.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** keep in mind to make a short intro. Please don't spend too much time on it. And remember, it's all about the audience.

##### Step3 Show, not just tell

Showing the audience what the channel is about is essential. Therefore, you need to spend some time selecting your best footage and graphics to showcase and illustrate your content.

One of the easiest ways is to use perfect music. So if you want to know how to select the right song, go and look at our new release,[the power of music](https://youtu.be/DSyxd9ARmsc), where we teach you everything you need to know for this.

##### Step4 Channel values

Here, you should explain to your audience the purpose of your channel and what they can expect from you. At this stage, new potential viewers can get you, whether your goal is to entertain them, teach something specific, or discuss certain topics and how you intend to achieve them.

![an example of a creative trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-3.jpg)

**Determine the style of your video**

You can refer to the most popular style in your area. Then, making the possibilities endless, you name it!

* A **vlogger video,** in which you have to record your daily activities. You can utilize a special occasion or a visit to historical sites or other landscapes of nature.
* A **Gamer video,** in which you will record your reaction to those chilly horror games or maybe competitive gaming where you can cherish your achievements with your audience.
* Introduce new **challenges** through your videos.
* Introduce **voiceovers** over motion captures.
* Storyteller, in which you will tell about fictional and non-fictional moments.

##### Step5 Schedule

Schedules are vital if you want regularly engaging viewers. The audience will be kept track of your activities and be there as soon as you upload your video. Also, new viewers know when to expect new content from you and commit to your goal, so they know your strategy.

![video posts schedules](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/youtube-trailer-4.jpg)

##### Step6 Call to action

What is a Video CTA? A CTA is an action you want your target audience to do after watching a trailer. And that is to subscribe to your YouTube channel.

Tips for your CTA in your trailer

* Please keep it simple, and do not overdo it. Make sure to keep the trailer under a minute or at least two minutes.
* There is no need to ask them to follow you on other platforms other than YouTube.
* If you feel these platforms will keep your audience on track, then do so.
* Beginners should refrain from doing it.
* Keep it friendly and give them the option to do so.

**Best Practice To Create an Ideal Trailer for Your YouTube Channel**

All the details have been shared on creating an ideal trailer for your YouTube channel. To make it simple, check out these three takeaways.

* Keep all the information related to your channel in the trailer, and be true to yourself and your content style.
* You do not want to switch from a style so frequently that it will affect your views and subscribers.
* Repetition will kill off the vibe of a good trailer. Do not use recurrent images or clips in your video

Alright! Following the steps mentioned above, you will be able to create a good YouTube trailer that will not only attract more subscribers to your channel. It will also allow them to stay hooked on your new and upcoming content. If you know more tips, share them with us.
