Can you buy 1 million YouTube views? Won't YouTube ban your account?

Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.

Buying views isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules (it is against the spirit of the rules and can still get you in trouble), depending on how you do it (in general: buying real-people views is technically not against the rules and buying bot views is definitely against them). There are many companies that claim to sell high-quality views that can actually get you in trouble.

So, who can you trust?

## **How to Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

Something to watch out for is if a service says you will reach 1 million views almost overnight. These sites either cannot really deliver on the time frame they promise or are not providing ‘real’ views. They may be using bots that generate a large number of fake views quickly, which can be dangerous for your channel.

What you want are high retention views from real humans. Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.

Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.

Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.

It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube's rules and can be done safely, [buying subscribers is more dangerous](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

[BuyViewsReview](http://buyviewsreview.com/) is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel.

Here are BuyViewsReveiew’s top 3 trusted providers from whom you can buy 1 million YouTube views safely:

[How to Research Keywords on YouTube?](#part2)

## Why Do We Need to Research YouTube Keywords?

Researching YouTube keywords is essential to your success. Here are three reasons why you might want to consider YouTube keyword research.

#### Helps You Know What Your Audience Is Searching for

Keyword research allows you to understand what people search for when they are on YouTube. In turn, this helps you know what your potential customers are seeking. You'll then include these terms on your content to increase the chances of your audience finding you on YouTube.

#### It Helps You Rank Higher

You can use YouTube videos to promote brand awareness and market your product. Having high-ranking videos is a cost-effective way to push your target audience through the sales funnel.

When creating YouTube videos, you need to ensure you are reaching your target audience. And that is why researching keywords is crucial.

Once you have performed YouTube keyword research and determined the most suitable keywords for your topic, you can now use them to create target content for your audience. In turn, this will help you increase the number of subscribers on your YouTube channel. Your chances of your video showing up on YouTube will increase, which will bring traffic to your business.

#### It's the Cheapest Way to Market Your Products or Services

Video marketing is expensive, and that is why you have to find every possible edge for your video marketing if you want to lower your costs and increase your ROI. For this reason, keyword research will ensure your audience finds you without spending loads of money that you could have used on services like Google Ads.

Because keyword research allows your target audience to find you, this means more opportunities for you. Most of the users will share entertaining videos.

## How to Research Keywords on YouTube?

There are several ways of conducting keyword research for YouTube to find out what people are searching for and determine the content in your video. They include:

#### 1\. Using YouTube Search

![youtube keyword search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-keyword-research-5.png)

Although this method doesn't provide all available search options, it's still good for getting an idea of the type of keyword with which you're dealing.

You can start your research by typing the keywords into YouTube's search bar and reviewing the displayed results. It might be helpful to check out similar videos or video playlists. If your search seems too wide, you can enter several keywords at once (separated by commas), which will help you find better results.

#### 2\. Using Google's Keyword Planner Tool

![use google keyword planner for yuotube keyword research](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-keyword-research-6.png)

This tool is helpful for keyword difficulty and monthly searches volume assessment. If you only want to know the number of organic visits a given keyword gets, Google Keyword Planner might be helpful. The tool allows you to create lists consisting of related keywords and provides information about CPC (cost per click) and potential traffic in general.

#### 3\. Using YouTube Suggestions

What makes YouTube unique is its ability to suggest content based on your location, subscription, and watch history. You can use this method to find keyword ideas if you have subscribed to relevant channels. Also, you can rely on YouTube suggestions to find out whether a topic is popular or not.

#### 4\. Using YouTube Analytics

#### 5\. Using Third-Party YouTube Keyword Tools

Some of these tools also offer similar features, including recommendations based on your existing subscriptions. Let's look at some of the popular YouTube tools that you can use.
