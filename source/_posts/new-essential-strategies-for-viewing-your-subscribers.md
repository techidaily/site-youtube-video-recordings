## Part 1: How to See Your YouTube Subscribers List?

Finding out who your subscribers are on YouTube is a simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort.

1\. In order to do so, you first need to go to your channel's home page and then click on the Creator Studio icon located in the upper right corner of the screen next to your profile picture.

![YouTube Subscriber Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-create-studio.jpg)

You can also access the Creator Studio by clicking on your icon in the top right corner of any screen on YouTube and selecting it from the drop-down menu.

2\. Once the Creator Studio opens, you'll be able to see different menus such as Analytics and Video Manager.

3\. You'll need to click on the Community menu, which provides insight into messages or comments among other things.

![YouTube Creator Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-youtube-subscriber-community-create-studio.jpg)

![Finding YouTube Subscribers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-youtube-subscriber-in-community.jpg)

Constantly checking the list of subscribers is a great way to keep track of new subscribers to your channel, which is important if you want to know how many new subscribers you got within a day or a week.

## Part 2: How to See Which of Your Subscribers are the Most Popular

The list of subscribers to your channel offered by YouTube's Creator Studio can be used for a variety of different purposes. You can compare your channel to channels with a similar number of subscribers, or you can find out how many users that have subscribed to your channel have around the same (or even more) subscribers than you do. If you are thinking about [creating a collab video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-collab-videos-and-grow-your-channel-206.html), your list of subscribers can be a great source of potential partners.

So in order to see which of your subscribers are the most popular, you simply need to change the settings in the Subscribers panel from most recent to most popular.

## Part 3: How to See Other People’s Subscribers

Seeing the list of subscribers on other people's channels is no longer possible on YouTube, even though it was a common feature in the past.

What you can do is select one of your subscribers from the subscriber list on your channel, and go to their channel and then click on the About option that will show you the number of subscribers and the total number of views to the channel (or [use one of these tools to see the sub count of any channel in real-time](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Unfortunately, YouTube channel owners can no longer browse through other people's subscribers and for that reason, their interactions with potential subscribers are somewhat limited.

If you want to get more subscribers, you must consider your channel's branding. Want to improve your branding? [Click here to see examples from popular channels that have nailed their brand.](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-brand-your-youtube-channel-to-get-more-subscribers-411.html)

## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

The first step is to decide on a business specialty. Prepare a list of the sectors you'll be covering in your films. It's easy for your thoughts to wander when you're trying to cover too many topics and niches. Pick a few appropriate niches based on your interests and/or experience. For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

#### \- Describe The Purpose of Your Channel

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things? Perhaps you simply wish to entertain others by sharing stories. Outline the goal you want to accomplish with your channel so that your videos have meaning. It will also help you get off to a good and consistent start rather than attempting to cover everything all at once.

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar

#### It will be easier to maintain consistency if you have a regular schedule. It assures your subscribers that new videos will be released on the scheduled dates. It also includes a thorough timeline that you can use to plan your activities and keep on track
