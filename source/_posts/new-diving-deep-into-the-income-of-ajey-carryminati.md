## Part 2: How to Merge YouTube Videos Online

[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

YouTube Video Editor is a browser-based video editor released by YouTube itself. It enables users to make minor edits to videos they've uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.

### Step 3. Merge YouTube videos with transition

By adding transitions, YouTube videos will flow nicely from one to the next. To do so, switch to Transition tab, and drag the desired transition to the Timeline. Alternatively, right click any transition and choose "Apply to All" and "Random to All" from the popup menu to add transitions between YouTube videos in seconds.

### Step 4. Merge multiple YouTube files into one

Make sure you are satisfied with everything. You can click Play button to preview how YouTube videos will be merged. If the result is good, click "Export" button to save the YouTube video as one.

![export in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg)

Therefore, go to the "Format" tab and select one desired format and click Create to start merging YouTube videos. By the way, if you want to play the merged YouTube files on iPod, iPhone, iPad, choose "Device" and select your device from the list. You can also directly upload back to YouTube for sharing or burn to DVD for playing on TV.

[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

YouTube Video Editor is a browser-based video editor released by YouTube itself. It enables users to make minor edits to videos they've uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.

##### Get access to the editor

Sign in to your YouTube (or Google) account. Click "Upload">> "Edit" to the Video Editor tab.
