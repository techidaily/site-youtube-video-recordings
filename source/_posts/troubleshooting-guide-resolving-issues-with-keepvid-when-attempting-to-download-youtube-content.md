You enabled Java in your browser, turned off your computer gadget maybe, and even wiped out all your cookies and Jave cache, but KeepVid just stopped downloading videos from Dailymotion, Vimeo. Why? Why the others can still use KeepVid to download videos but you can't? I don't know either, because I am also the one that still facing KeepVid not downloading problem.

## Why Do You Need KeepVid Alternative?

1\. "I used KeepVid to download videos some days ago. But KeepVid not downloading properly today. Nothing happens after I input the video URL and hit download button. What's wrong with KeepVid? How can I clear away this KeepVid download problem?" 

2\. " KeepVid's still not working on Windows and Mac for me even after installing and enabling java. Is it just me or is it not working for everyone? If it's KeepVid that's fudging up, then I must rather not waste my time with it anymore."

3\. "KeepVid is not downloading anymore. It was working yesterday. I paste the link, click the download button and then it will show me the different video files I can download. Then when I choose the file type (quality) I want, it will just produce another page and nothing happens. There is no more new prompt asking me if I want to save the file."

I could keep listing the problems of KeepVid, but there is no point. Why you are still keep trying to save KeepVid, if it keeps having video downloading problem such frequently. I'd rather go with this standalone free video downloader to solve - 5KPlayer.
