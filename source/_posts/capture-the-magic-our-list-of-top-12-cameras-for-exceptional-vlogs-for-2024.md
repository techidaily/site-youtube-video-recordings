 | ![Sony RX 100 V](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-8.png)    | Best daily vlogging camera: Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX 100 V You don't have to be a filmmaking pro if you want to use a compact camera to record all sorts of videos. Sony's Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800\. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V's multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  **PROS** _\- Light and easy to carry around_ _\- Produces high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Short battery life_ _\- Lacking a touchscreen_                                                                                                                      |

| ![Canon M100](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png)       | Best cheap vlogging camera: Canon EOS M100 Canon's EOS M100 is small and powerful. This mirrorless camera produces full HD videos at 60 fps. It doesnâ€™t, however, shoot 4K footage. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 7 image processor ensure that your vlogs are always in focus and rich in detail. The Canon EOS M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options, offering ISO values as high as 25600, making it a great option for vloggers that often shoot their videos under difficult light conditions. The 3-inch touchscreen LCD lets you control focus points, navigate through the camera's menu, or watch videos you've created. The screen can also be tilted in the upward direction to provide you a better preview of the shot you're recording. The camera has a built-in Wi-Fi with NFC so you can transfer your videos seamlessly to a computer and have fun in the process. The Canon EOS M100 is currently one of the best entry-level cameras for daily vlogging on the market because it produces videos in great picture quality that you don't have to spend a fortune for.  **PROS** _\- Affordable_ _\- Great connectivity options_   **CONS** _\- Lacks advanced video recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Canon M100](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-4.png)       | Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 wins this category as well in our books because it's a powerful, feature-rich camera that's also very affordable. In case you missed it, check out my review on the [Canon EOS M100](#Best-cheap-vlogging-camera).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200. This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  **PROS** _\- Has an external microphone port_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5Sâ€™ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions. This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The cameraâ€™s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canonâ€™s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80Dâ€™s DIGIC 6 image processor. If youâ€™re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Sony's Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800\. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V's multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  **PROS** _\- Light and easy to carry around_ _\- Produces high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Short battery life_ _\- Lacking a touchscreen_                                                                                                                      |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200. This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  **PROS** _\- Has an external microphone port_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5Sâ€™ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions. This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The cameraâ€™s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canonâ€™s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80Dâ€™s DIGIC 6 image processor. If youâ€™re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Sony's Cyber-shot series is famous for its cutting-edge features and the DSC-RX 100 V model is not an exception. This camera is equipped with a 20.1 MP Exmor RS BSI CMOS Sensor that supports ISO sensitivities up to ISO 12800\. You can record footage in UHD 4K at 30 or 24 fps, although with a five-minute limit, as well as Full HD videos at a maximum of 960 fps when recording in the HFR mode. The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX 100 V ships with a non-interchangeable Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T lens that performs well under low-light conditions and in broad daylight. The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording. DSC RX-100 V's multi-functionality makes it one of the best cameras for daily vlogging, especially for vloggers who are planning on shooting vlogs in various locations.  **PROS** _\- Light and easy to carry around_ _\- Produces high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Short battery life_ _\- Lacking a touchscreen_                                                                                                                      |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200. This camera uses the Canon EF lens mount, so you can choose the lens that best suits your needs. The Canon EOS M50 can capture UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps, and it also lets you record 120 fps slow-motion videos at 720p.  **PROS** _\- Has an external microphone port_ _\- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder_   **CONS** _\- No image stabilization_ _\- Battery life could be longer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5Sâ€™ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |
| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is a great entry-level vlogging camera that delivers great power at a low price. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 has a DIGIC 7 image processor and a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor that lets you extend the ISO value to 51200 and shoot your vlogs even under low light conditions. This camera can capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, and it features a 9-point AF system and dual pixel CMOS AF technologies that provide precise and quick focusing even when there is not much light. The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The cameraâ€™s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canonâ€™s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80Dâ€™s DIGIC 6 image processor. If youâ€™re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The camera features a fast hybrid AF system with 315 phase-detection points and an anti-motion blur mode that allows you to keep the subjects of your vlogs in focus throughout your recording.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5Sâ€™ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The cameraâ€™s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canonâ€™s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80Dâ€™s DIGIC 6 image processor. If youâ€™re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
