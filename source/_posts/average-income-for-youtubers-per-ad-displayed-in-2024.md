### Hosting Q/A Sessions

Another effective way to use the YouTube community tab to its full potential revolves around hosting a Questions and Answer Session. The general public likes to relate to the bloggers and influencers and know about them. A Q/A session sparks the connection between the two where the viewers ask different personal and professional questions.

It is a huge possibility that you gain new followers, and they stick to the way you communicate and give importance to your subscribers.

### Ask for Inspiration and Video

The most common practice of renowned content creators is to engage the audience and ask them for inspiration in the following video. You can ask your subscribers what they want to see you act on and what topic should be covered. Do not hesitate to use polls and gauge interest in general and stereotypical subjects.
