Whether you need YouTube icons and logos to use as pop-up graphics in your videos, to serve as your channel icon, to use as watermarks, or to liven up your channel art or video thumbnails – don’t worry. There are lots of places to get them.

We’ve made a list of 6 sites where you can download icons and logos for free for YouTub videos, and explained how they work.

> * [Flaticon.com](#flaticon)
> * [Freepik.com](#freepik)
> * [Seeklogo.net](#seeklogo)
> * [IconArchive.com](#iconarchive)
> * [Logaster.com](#logaster)
> * [Icons8.com](#icons8)

You might also want to check out these YouTube channels offering free [profile picture templates](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html).

## 1\. [Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Great selection of icons/logos_
> * _It's easy to change the colors before you download_

I’m putting Flaticon.com right at the top of this list because it has something that really sets it apart from the other sites on this list – it lets you edit pre-made icons before you download them.

You start out on Flaticon by searching for a theme like beauty, gaming, flowers, or emojis. I searched for ‘birds’ and found these cuties.

![ YouTube Logo Icon Download Site Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_These aren’t all the birds on Flaticon, just a few._ _They had a huge selection in all the different searches I tried._

I clicked on the brown bird to open up the download screen, and then clicked into ‘Edit icon’. There may be a pop up that tells you editing tools are only available to registered users, but it’s wrong. Just close it and keep going, unless you want to register.

![  Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon-example-1.jpg)

You can edit the colors in your icon just by clicking on the color you want to replace, and then clicking on the color in the color selector you want to replace it with. I made my birdie FLY.

![ Edit Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_I never apologize for puns._

Once you like the look of your icon, just click Download. You will be prompted to choose a format. PNG is the most popular because it is supported the most places (including on YouTube), and because it allows for a transparent background.

After clicking on a format you will also be prompted to choose a size for your image. It’s always best to go with the largest image you can – its way easier to shrink things and keep them looking good than it is to have to enlarge them.

![ download Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

Flaticon has a great selection, it’s free, and they make it really easy to edit your creations. I would strongly recommend this site to anyone in the market for an icon or logo.

Flaticon asks that you include an “Icon made by \[author link\] from <www.flaticon.com> ” somewhere (i.e. video description, channel ‘about’ section) when you use their icons for free.

## 2\. [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Good selection of icons._
> * _No way to customise them on the site._
> * _Attribution requried._

On freepik, you start off by searching for a theme (like the genre of your YouTube title or the topic of a video, i.e. ‘makeup’ or ‘music’). I searched for ‘cat’.

![ download Logo Icon on Freepik](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-freepik.jpg)

_A few of the sets available on freepik. The crown icon means you need to be a paying Premium member, but most things are free._

You can’t edit on freepik, and in order to download for free you need to include an attribution/credit to freepik where you use the images.

You do not choose what format to download your images in on freepik. When you hit ‘Free Download’ it will automatically download a zip file which will contain both a .jpg and a .eps. The EPS is editable in any ‘vector graphics editor’, like Adobe Illustrator, and YouTube supports .jpg files.

## 3\. [Seeklogo.net](https://www.seeklogo.net/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Logos from major brands_
> * _Great for channels that do product reviews_

Seeklogo.net has a slightly more corporate slant than some of the other sites on this list. It has logos for a lot of major companies and brands available for download.

In the ‘search’ on Seeklogo.net, you can type in the name of a brand or industry and see if the well-known logo you’re looking for is available. This may be especially useful for people with sports related channels since they have a lot of logos for major teams.

I searched for YouTube – you never know when you might need the YouTube logo.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Seeklogo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-icons-logos-on-seeklogo.jpg)

Although the site does not advertise PNG in the list of formats on their front page, downloads do include PNG versions (which is useful if you need transparency and don’t have a program which can edit vector files, like .eps).

## 4\. [IconArchive.com](http://www.iconarchive.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Site has an office/business slant._
> * _Detailed search tool lets you sort by color, theme, etc._

IconArchive has a huge selection of icons with somewhat of an office/business slant. I searched for ‘flower’ and half the results were of file-folders with flowers on them.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

_Could be cool for a lifestyle video about school or work?_

My favorite thing about IconArchive is its search features. It allows you to filter results by color, size (down to the specific resolution), category, background color, style, and a lot more.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

Color is under ‘Display’, meaning that it won’t filter out results that have different colors it’ll just list the color you select first.

The ‘Category’ filter is useful because there are some genres you probably recognize there, like ‘Lifestyle’. However, you should be careful not to over-filter. This site is pretty literal in how it categorizes. For example – there are no ‘flower’ images under ‘Lifestyle’.

Downloads are available in different sizes and formats including PNG. PNG is always a good option because it is supported by YouTube and includes transparent backgrounds.

Note that all of your different download buttons will be located underneath your image. They favor those ads that look like ‘download’ or ‘start now’ buttons, and the ads sit right next to the images on the right, so it’s easy to get confused and click on the ad.

## 5\. [Logaster.com](https://www.logaster.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You'll have to pay for larger images._
> * _Focused more on businesses._
> * _Incorporates your channel name._

Logaster is really a service for businesses – they make and sell business cards, letterheads, and other office-y things like that. However, they are still a good choice for YouTubers because they have a free logo creator. Sort of.

You actually have to pay $9.99 to get larger images and remove the watermark, but the process is free.

When you arrive on Logaster there’s a button right on their home page that says ‘Create a logo for free’. Click on it.

In Step 1 it’ll ask for your company name and an activity type. You just need to put in your channel name and choose something from the activity drop down that you focus on in your videos.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster Start Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-on-logaster.jpg)

My heart burns with the secret desire to be YouTube’s Neil Degrasse Tyson (it doesn’t really, but he is super cool) so I tried ‘Katie Does Science’ and ‘Science, Studies, Education’. Here’s what it came up with:

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-suggestions-on-logaster.jpg)

_There are 10 pages of suggestions!_

You can see how, unless you have a short channel name, you’re probably not going to be able to use any of these as an icon, but a lot of them would look cool on a banner. There’s an ‘Edit Logo Concept’ button which allows you to make changes to the layout, but you can still only choose from preset layouts. For example, some logo concepts allow you to choose whether the icon is above your text or next to it.

After you click ‘save’ in the last step you’ll be prompted to provide an email address and password. Once you sign in, you’ll be able to download a small logo for free, or purchase the higher resolution image.

I personally wouldn’t recommend buying an image from here unless your channel is for your small business and you need things like branded business cards and letterhead. This site might be better for gathering inspiration than actually downloading a logo from.

## 6\. [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You need to link back to them to use their icons._
> * _You can edit the colors on the site and even add details._
> * _There's a size limit on the free service (100x100px)_

At Icons8 they have free and paid services. If you download an icon for free it will be a PNG file (which should be fine, YouTube supports PNG and it’s good for transparency) that is no larger than 100x100px. This is not ideal since YouTube recommends 800x800px for profile pictures, but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker either. Profile pictures render down to much smaller than that.

You will also need to link to Icons8 if you use their icons for free (i.e. in the ‘about’ section of your channel page).

To get started on Icons8, type something into the search bar on the home page that you think might work as an icon or as part of whatever graphics you have planned. I typed in ‘game’ for this one, since gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube. Here are a few of the results that came up:

![ Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

_Lower down in the results there were different kinds of sports balls, hand-held gaming systems, playing cards, joy sticks, baseball caps and more._

After you find an icon you like, click on it and it will appear on the right side of your screen where you’ll be able to make a few changes (an editing screen will pop up once you start clicking on things). You can edit your colors, overlay small decals, add text, and add a border, change your background and adjust your size. Here’s the editing screen:

![ Edit Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can give your icon a pretty different look from its default. Check this out:

![ Change Gaming Logo Icon background on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gaming-icons-logos-background-on-icons8.jpg)

You cannot download your icon from the editing screen. You need to click Save, and then download it from the main display screen here:

![ Donwload Gaming Logo Icon  on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can change the size with that drop down menu, but you’ll be limited in your options if you don’t want to pay.

I downloaded my image and tried to see how it would look as an icon/profile picture. As you can see, it was pretty blurry in the preview:

![ Add Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg)

However, the preview is larger than the actual profile picture. Once I set it, it looked alright.

![ Preview Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg)

Looking for somewhere you can build your own icon/logo from scratch? Check out this [list of logo makers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-9-free-youtube-logo-makers-304.html).

After downloading the icons or logos, it is time to add them to your YouTube video. Here I recommend our [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Below is a video tutorial about [how to add a logo to video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Remember to download the free trial version to test.

![ Edit Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_I never apologize for puns._

Once you like the look of your icon, just click Download. You will be prompted to choose a format. PNG is the most popular because it is supported the most places (including on YouTube), and because it allows for a transparent background.

After clicking on a format you will also be prompted to choose a size for your image. It’s always best to go with the largest image you can – its way easier to shrink things and keep them looking good than it is to have to enlarge them.

![ download Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

Flaticon has a great selection, it’s free, and they make it really easy to edit your creations. I would strongly recommend this site to anyone in the market for an icon or logo.

Flaticon asks that you include an “Icon made by \[author link\] from <www.flaticon.com> ” somewhere (i.e. video description, channel ‘about’ section) when you use their icons for free.

## 2\. [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Good selection of icons._
> * _No way to customise them on the site._
> * _Attribution requried._

On freepik, you start off by searching for a theme (like the genre of your YouTube title or the topic of a video, i.e. ‘makeup’ or ‘music’). I searched for ‘cat’.

![ download Logo Icon on Freepik](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-freepik.jpg)

_A few of the sets available on freepik. The crown icon means you need to be a paying Premium member, but most things are free._

You can’t edit on freepik, and in order to download for free you need to include an attribution/credit to freepik where you use the images.

You do not choose what format to download your images in on freepik. When you hit ‘Free Download’ it will automatically download a zip file which will contain both a .jpg and a .eps. The EPS is editable in any ‘vector graphics editor’, like Adobe Illustrator, and YouTube supports .jpg files.

## 3\. [Seeklogo.net](https://www.seeklogo.net/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Logos from major brands_
> * _Great for channels that do product reviews_

Seeklogo.net has a slightly more corporate slant than some of the other sites on this list. It has logos for a lot of major companies and brands available for download.

In the ‘search’ on Seeklogo.net, you can type in the name of a brand or industry and see if the well-known logo you’re looking for is available. This may be especially useful for people with sports related channels since they have a lot of logos for major teams.

I searched for YouTube – you never know when you might need the YouTube logo.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Seeklogo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-icons-logos-on-seeklogo.jpg)

Although the site does not advertise PNG in the list of formats on their front page, downloads do include PNG versions (which is useful if you need transparency and don’t have a program which can edit vector files, like .eps).

## 4\. [IconArchive.com](http://www.iconarchive.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Site has an office/business slant._
> * _Detailed search tool lets you sort by color, theme, etc._

IconArchive has a huge selection of icons with somewhat of an office/business slant. I searched for ‘flower’ and half the results were of file-folders with flowers on them.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

_Could be cool for a lifestyle video about school or work?_

My favorite thing about IconArchive is its search features. It allows you to filter results by color, size (down to the specific resolution), category, background color, style, and a lot more.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on IconArchive Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-icons-logos-on-iconarchive.jpg)

Color is under ‘Display’, meaning that it won’t filter out results that have different colors it’ll just list the color you select first.

The ‘Category’ filter is useful because there are some genres you probably recognize there, like ‘Lifestyle’. However, you should be careful not to over-filter. This site is pretty literal in how it categorizes. For example – there are no ‘flower’ images under ‘Lifestyle’.

Downloads are available in different sizes and formats including PNG. PNG is always a good option because it is supported by YouTube and includes transparent backgrounds.

Note that all of your different download buttons will be located underneath your image. They favor those ads that look like ‘download’ or ‘start now’ buttons, and the ads sit right next to the images on the right, so it’s easy to get confused and click on the ad.

## 5\. [Logaster.com](https://www.logaster.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You'll have to pay for larger images._
> * _Focused more on businesses._
> * _Incorporates your channel name._

Logaster is really a service for businesses – they make and sell business cards, letterheads, and other office-y things like that. However, they are still a good choice for YouTubers because they have a free logo creator. Sort of.

You actually have to pay $9.99 to get larger images and remove the watermark, but the process is free.

When you arrive on Logaster there’s a button right on their home page that says ‘Create a logo for free’. Click on it.

In Step 1 it’ll ask for your company name and an activity type. You just need to put in your channel name and choose something from the activity drop down that you focus on in your videos.

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster Start Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-on-logaster.jpg)

My heart burns with the secret desire to be YouTube’s Neil Degrasse Tyson (it doesn’t really, but he is super cool) so I tried ‘Katie Does Science’ and ‘Science, Studies, Education’. Here’s what it came up with:

![ YouTube Logo Icon on Logaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/branding-icons-logos-suggestions-on-logaster.jpg)

_There are 10 pages of suggestions!_

You can see how, unless you have a short channel name, you’re probably not going to be able to use any of these as an icon, but a lot of them would look cool on a banner. There’s an ‘Edit Logo Concept’ button which allows you to make changes to the layout, but you can still only choose from preset layouts. For example, some logo concepts allow you to choose whether the icon is above your text or next to it.

After you click ‘save’ in the last step you’ll be prompted to provide an email address and password. Once you sign in, you’ll be able to download a small logo for free, or purchase the higher resolution image.

I personally wouldn’t recommend buying an image from here unless your channel is for your small business and you need things like branded business cards and letterhead. This site might be better for gathering inspiration than actually downloading a logo from.

## 6\. [Icons8.com](https://icons8.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _You need to link back to them to use their icons._
> * _You can edit the colors on the site and even add details._
> * _There's a size limit on the free service (100x100px)_

At Icons8 they have free and paid services. If you download an icon for free it will be a PNG file (which should be fine, YouTube supports PNG and it’s good for transparency) that is no larger than 100x100px. This is not ideal since YouTube recommends 800x800px for profile pictures, but it’s not necessarily a deal breaker either. Profile pictures render down to much smaller than that.

You will also need to link to Icons8 if you use their icons for free (i.e. in the ‘about’ section of your channel page).

To get started on Icons8, type something into the search bar on the home page that you think might work as an icon or as part of whatever graphics you have planned. I typed in ‘game’ for this one, since gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube. Here are a few of the results that came up:

![ Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

_Lower down in the results there were different kinds of sports balls, hand-held gaming systems, playing cards, joy sticks, baseball caps and more._

After you find an icon you like, click on it and it will appear on the right side of your screen where you’ll be able to make a few changes (an editing screen will pop up once you start clicking on things). You can edit your colors, overlay small decals, add text, and add a border, change your background and adjust your size. Here’s the editing screen:

![ Edit Gaming Logo Icon on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can give your icon a pretty different look from its default. Check this out:

![ Change Gaming Logo Icon background on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gaming-icons-logos-background-on-icons8.jpg)

You cannot download your icon from the editing screen. You need to click Save, and then download it from the main display screen here:

![ Donwload Gaming Logo Icon  on Icons8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gaming-icons-logos-on-icons8.jpg)

You can change the size with that drop down menu, but you’ll be limited in your options if you don’t want to pay.

I downloaded my image and tried to see how it would look as an icon/profile picture. As you can see, it was pretty blurry in the preview:

![ Add Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg)

However, the preview is larger than the actual profile picture. Once I set it, it looked alright.

![ Preview Gaming Logo Icon made with icons8 to YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gaming-icons-logos-made-with-icons8.jpg)

Looking for somewhere you can build your own icon/logo from scratch? Check out this [list of logo makers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-9-free-youtube-logo-makers-304.html).

After downloading the icons or logos, it is time to add them to your YouTube video.

Whether you need YouTube icons and logos to use as pop-up graphics in your videos, to serve as your channel icon, to use as watermarks, or to liven up your channel art or video thumbnails – don’t worry. There are lots of places to get them.

We’ve made a list of 6 sites where you can download icons and logos for free for YouTub videos, and explained how they work.

> * [Flaticon.com](#flaticon)
> * [Freepik.com](#freepik)
> * [Seeklogo.net](#seeklogo)
> * [IconArchive.com](#iconarchive)
> * [Logaster.com](#logaster)

You might also want to check out these YouTube channels offering free [profile picture templates](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html).

## 1\. [Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)

**Key Points:**

> * _Great selection of icons/logos_
> * _It's easy to change the colors before you download_

I’m putting Flaticon.com right at the top of this list because it has something that really sets it apart from the other sites on this list – it lets you edit pre-made icons before you download them.

You start out on Flaticon by searching for a theme like beauty, gaming, flowers, or emojis. I searched for ‘birds’ and found these cuties.

![ YouTube Logo Icon Download Site Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon.jpg)

_These aren’t all the birds on Flaticon, just a few._ _They had a huge selection in all the different searches I tried._

I clicked on the brown bird to open up the download screen, and then clicked into ‘Edit icon’. There may be a pop up that tells you editing tools are only available to registered users, but it’s wrong. Just close it and keep going, unless you want to register.

![  Logo Icon on Flaticon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icons-logos-on-flaticon-example-1.jpg)

## Proven Tactics: Top 10 Secrets for Novice Vloggers' Success

# YouTube Video Editing Tips for Beginner Editors

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.fr/filmora/filmora/MarionDubois.jpg)

##### Marion Dubois

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

Creating good-quality videos regularly can be difficult, especially when you are a beginner. The most crucial part of making a video is editing. This is the part where you have to look at every intricate detail. This is the part where you remove unwanted footage and place useful shots in their position. Every creator has their editing style by which they put their mark on their videos.

Editing can be a long and tedious process. It takes time, patience, and an immense amount of creativity to create a video good enough to impress the viewers. Here are few tips that will make your editing process easier and cut your editing time in half.

## Top 10 Video Editing Tips for YouTube Beginners

The following will not tell you how to edit your YouTube videos, but will surely make editing a little more convenient.

### 1\. Choose a Good Video Editor

One of the first things you have to do is make sure that you have chosen a video editor that is best for you.

Using either too complicated or too basic a video editor can only create problems for you. An advanced video editor may create very high-end, professional videos, but it will take months just to get the hang of the software. Whereas a free basic video editor may not give as many options as you’d need to edit your videos properly.

### 2\. Use Fast Computers

Being a video creator, you’ll have to store numerous huge files on your computer. To improve your current PC, you can invest in an SSD, which is a lot faster than the traditional hard disk.

SSD will not only improve your export, loading, and rendering time but it will allow you to access files and editing software much faster. Another improvement you can make to make your editing process faster is to increase the RAM of your computer (it should be at least 8 GB). Also, make sure to get the recommended video card and processor for your video editor.

### 3\. Invest Your Time in Video Editing Tutorials

You can watch video editing tutorials to learn and perfect the art of video editing. You can easily find free tutorials online, visiting websites like Skillshare and Red Giant tutorials to access free video editing tutorials. Search for tutorials that are specific to the editing software you use. You can also search for tutorials that will help improve your content.

### 4\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn the keyboard shortcuts for various functions in the software, especially the ones that are usually repeated throughout the process like undo, redo, delete, etc.

You can also invest in an Editing keyboard, they are software specific and already have keyboard shortcut icons in them.

### 5\. Add Good Music

Another important tip to keep your audience all ears is to add good music to your videos. Whether it is background music or a soundtrack in between shots, it has to pair well with your video.

If you are on a budget and don’t want to spend money on music, there are royalty-free options available. But, know that good music only comes at a price.

### 6\. Add Text, Titles, and Graphics

You can choose from a wide variety of text and titles. You’ll also have tools to enhance the graphics of your video. When you have so many options, choosing the right one can be difficult. It is better to keep the font of the text simple.

You can also use video editors to add flashy motion graphics to your videos. You can either create your graphics by hand or you can also choose from a variety of ready-made graphics templates.

### 7\. Don’t Forget to Color Correction

Not color correcting your videos may render them looking dull and lifeless. Color is one of the major elements that play a crucial part in setting the mood of your video. Depending upon the type of content you’re portraying in the video, you can use a color scheme to highlight specific aspects or to evoke certain emotions in the audience.

Color correction is used to make your video appear consistent throughout the scenes. Whereas color grading is used to make videos stand out. Both are essential to differentiate certain scenes from others.

### 8\. Learn Important Terms

Learn the terms commonly used in video editing. It will help you become proficient with the software and the process of editing. Some common terms used in the editing sphere are:

* **Cutaways**
* **Jump Cuts**
* **Match Cuts/Match-Action Montage**
* **J and L Cuts**
* **Cutting on Action**

### 9\. Store Your Video Files on an External Drive

Storing your huge video files on an external drive will free up a lot of space on your computer. This will help speed up your device so you don’t have to worry about slow rendering.

### 10\. Make Copies of Your Files

Always make more than two copies of your files. You can use the 321 rule. The rule is to make 3 copies of your files, store them in two different places, where one place should be physically separate from the other.

### 5\. Add Good Music

Depending upon the type of content you’re portraying in the video, you can use a color scheme to highlight specific aspects or to evoke certain emotions in the audience.

Color correction is used to make your video appear consistent throughout the scenes. Whereas color grading is used to make videos stand out. Both are essential to differentiate certain scenes from others.
