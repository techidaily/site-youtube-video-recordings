[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

Next, click **"Titles"** from the toolbar and open the **"Subtitles"** tab from the left menu. **Double-click** the subtitle to download and preview it.

Step 3 Drag the downloaded subtitle template and drop it in the timeline. Now, adjust it in your video along with the marker point. Double-click the **subtitle template** in the timeline and type the text from the video voiceover.
