## How does sub for sub work?

With YouTube sub for sub, you market your YouTube channel to get more subscribers. Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.

You can do this on different channels such as YouTube live videos, among other channels. But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.

## Tips & tricks to use sub for sub

Subforsub isn’t genuine and all you get is bot subscribers who don’t engage. However, you can use available tricks to gain popularity.

#### \- Using fake accounts

![youtube sub for sub - use fake account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-2.png)

A user should only run one genuine YouTube account. However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.

#### \- Subscribers don’t watch the videos

Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing. Your mission is to gain as many subs as possible even if your watch time doesn’t go up. This doesn’t bring any positivity to your channel rather an increased number of subscribers.

#### \- Reach out to friends

![youtube sub for sub - reach out to friends](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-3.png)

You can also boost your sub for sub by reaching out to friends to inform them of your channel and ask for subscriptions in return for theirs as well. This, however, could be a slow process as not all your friends will be attracted to what you do.

#### \- Don’t do subforsub for followers

A subforsub may not give you followers parse. So, don’t get into it for genuine followers. Those who sub to your channel won’t follow you in most cases. Rather, they might unsubscribe after a short duration of time.

#### \- Use channel branding

This trick will glue viewers to your channel. These can include banner art to welcome everyone who clicks into your channel.

## Additional thoughts - Should we rely on subforsub to get more subscribers?

You should not rely on subforsub as it doesn’t give the real figures but manipulates the outcome. Nonetheless, you need real subscribers to climb the YouTube ladder. That’s the best way to push the YouTube algorithm. There are genuine aspects of gaining subscribers to grow your channel.

#### Get to social media platforms

![youtube sub for sub - look for subscriber on social platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-4.png)

These include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other sites. Introduce your YouTube channel to your followers and remind them to subscribe. Likewise, demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to.

#### Upload content consistently

Ensure your upload schedule is consistent and you’ll see viewers having a reason to subscribe to your channel. Once you introduce your channel with the first video, post a second and third video to build more momentum on your potential subscribers.

#### Incorporate YouTube stories

![take advantage of youtube stories to get more subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-5.png)

Stories can be a good starting point for those who have not subscribed to your content yet despite watching. Short video stories will attract viewers’ attention and want to get more from your channel.

#### Use Calls to Action

![cta to get more youtube subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-6.png)

Ask your audience to subscribe after watching your videos. A great idea is to use animation or graphics to attract the viewers’ attention instantly. Other free options like green screen are also available for use.

#### Make it easy for viewers to understand your channel

You can make it easy by giving your viewers a guided tour. By this, they’ll know where to find important sections like comments. You can also create a channel banner that tells your audience what you do. They’ll soon familiarize themselves with your channel and be friends in no time.

#### Build a relationship with your audience

It is good to connect with your audience in various aspects. Expressing yourself probably in front of a camera has a deeper impact. You can also use illustrations to bring out your points for a quick understanding. Engaging them in the process is the best way to make them feel like they belong and eventually turn into subscribers.

#### Focus on the video that’s working for you

You should know which video is working and which is not. Judge and put more emphasis on the video that’s working for you. Check out which videos turn viewers into subscribers as that’s your main aim. More so, be creative and innovative.
