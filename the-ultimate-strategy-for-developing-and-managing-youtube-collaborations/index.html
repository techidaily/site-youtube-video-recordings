<p>If you watch YouTube then you don’t need to be told why it’s a good idea for creators to collaborate. You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p>
<p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:</p>

<h2 id="6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners"><a href="#6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners"></a><strong>6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners</strong></h2><p>Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself when you’re looking for potential collaborators on YouTube.</p>
<h4 id="1-Who-Are-My-Friends"><a href="#1-Who-Are-My-Friends" class="headerlink" title="1. Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p>
<p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p>
<p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p>
<h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p>
<p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p>
<h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p>
<h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p>
<h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"
                      alt="collab pitch examples"
                ></p>
<p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some more tips:</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p>
<h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p>
<h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p>
<h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p>
<p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p>
<h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p>
<p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p>
<h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p>
<p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p>
<p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p>
<h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p>
<h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p>
<h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p>
<p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p>
<h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p>
<h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p>
<p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p>
<p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube? If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be and what kind of video would you make?</p>

<p>If you watch YouTube then you don’t need to be told why it’s a good idea for creators to collaborate. You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p>
<p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:</p>

<h2 id="6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners-1"><a href="#6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners-1" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners"></a><strong>6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners</strong></h2><p>Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself when you’re looking for potential collaborators on YouTube.</p>
<h4 id="1-Who-Are-My-Friends-1"><a href="#1-Who-Are-My-Friends-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p>
<p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-1"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p>
<p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p>
<h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-1"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p>
<p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p>
<h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-1"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p>
<h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-1"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-1" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p>
<h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area-1"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-1"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="collab pitch examples"
                ></p>
<p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some more tips:</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name-1"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content-1"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-1"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p>
<h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-1"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p>
<h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal-1"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p>
<h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page-1"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p>
<p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p>
<h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out-1"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out-1" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p>
<p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p>
<h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos-1"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch. The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p>
<p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p>
<p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p>
<h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations-1"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations-1" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p>
<h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab-1"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab-1" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p>
<h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-1"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p>
<p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p>
<h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab-1"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab-1" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p>
<h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos-1"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p>
<p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p>
<p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube? If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be and what kind of video would you make?</p>

The person whose channel the video appears on is the ‘host’ and the video is done in something closer to their usual style (which will be more appealing to their subscribers), and their collab partner is a guest. You might want to do two of these videos so you each have one for your own channel.</p>
<p> Depending on your YouTube niche, you might do a fun activity together or you might interview your guest about a subject you think your subscribers are interested in.</p>
<p>In order to pull off a collab like this, you need to be able to meet in person.</p>
<h4 id="Long-Distance-Collaborations-2"><a href="#Long-Distance-Collaborations-2" class="headerlink" title="Long Distance Collaborations"></a><strong>Long Distance Collaborations</strong></h4><p> It’s harder to collab if you can’t meet up, but it isn’t impossible. You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p>
<h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab-2"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab-2" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p>
<h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-2"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-2" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p>
<p>You may want to post your videos as unlisted initially if you’re worried about one of you taking longer to upload. Then, once your videos are both completely ready to go, you can switch their listing to ‘public’ at the exact same time.</p>
<h4 id="Promote-Your-Collab-2"><a href="#Promote-Your-Collab-2" class="headerlink" title="Promote Your Collab"></a><strong>Promote Your Collab</strong></h4><p>Before you post your collab videos, you might want to build hype by mentioning the upcoming collab video in your solo videos leading up to it. If you and your partner are active on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, you can do things like post behind the scenes pictures of your collab videos to generate excitement.</p>
<h4 id="Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos-2"><a href="#Comment-on-Each-Other’s-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Comment on Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Comment on Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>After you’ve posted your collabs, make sure to leave each other comments about how much fun it was working together. You might want to interact publicly on social media too. Overall, just be friends. You want to maintain this relationship to leave the door open to future collabs, and your viewers will want to believe in your friendship too. Your partner’s subscribers are more likely to be interested in you when they feel like you’re buddies with one of their favorite creators.</p>
<p> Make sure to discuss how much promotion you’ll each do for the collab before and after it launches. If one of you does a ton of promotion and the other just does one tweet, it won’t make the person who’s done way more promotion feel great.</p>
<p> Have you ever collaborated on YouTube? If you could collaborate with anyone, who would it be and what kind of video would you make?</p>

<p>If you watch YouTube then you don’t need to be told why it’s a good idea for creators to collaborate. You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p>
<p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging. Here are some tips:</p>

<h2 id="6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners-3"><a href="#6-Tips-About-Finding-Collab-Partners-3" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners"></a><strong>6 Tips About Finding Collab Partners</strong></h2><p>Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself when you’re looking for potential collaborators on YouTube.</p>
<h4 id="1-Who-Are-My-Friends-3"><a href="#1-Who-Are-My-Friends-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p>
<p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-3"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p>
<p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p>
<h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-3"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p>
<p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p>
<h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p>
<h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-3"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-3" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p>
<h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area-3"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-3"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="collab pitch examples"
                ></p>
<p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some more tips:</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name-3"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content-3"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-3"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p>
<h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-3"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p>
<h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal-3"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p>
<h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page-3"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p>
<p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p>
<h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out-3"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out-3" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together. Essentially, you just make your own video and let everyone know how much you like your partner’s channel (combined with linking your viewers to them), and they do the same.</p>
<p>Make sure to agree beforehand on how long you’ll spend plugging each other in your videos, so one of you doesn’t go on way longer than the other.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t a hugely effective method of collaborating if your goal is to grow (I wouldn’t check out someone’s channel just because I was told to), but it certainly is easy.</p>
<h4 id="Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos-3"><a href="#Be-Guests-in-Each-Other’s-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos"></a><strong>Be Guests in Each Other’s Videos</strong></h4><p>This might be the most fun type of collab to watch.

You can exchange footage to use in each other’s videos, or you can record a Google Hangout or Skype chat.</p>
<h2 id="Launching-Your-Collab-3"><a href="#Launching-Your-Collab-3" class="headerlink" title="Launching Your Collab"></a><strong>Launching Your Collab</strong></h2><p>Here are some tips for making sure both you and your partner get the most out of the collab videos you’ve made.</p>
<h4 id="Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-3"><a href="#Agree-on-a-Launch-Date-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time"></a><strong>Agree on a Launch Date&#x2F;Time</strong></h4><p>If you each have a video for your own channel then you want to make sure those go up at the same time. It’ll be awkward if you post your video and shout out your partner&#x2F;their collab video and when people go to check that out it isn’t up.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"
                      alt="Popular YouTube Thumbnail Layout"
                ></p>
<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-1"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-1" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-1"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-1"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-1"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-1"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-1" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-1"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-2"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-2" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-2"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-2"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-2" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-2"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-2"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-2" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-2"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-2" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-2"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-2" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-2"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"

<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-3"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-3"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-3"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-3"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-3"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-3"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-3" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-3"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-3"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>
<p>Alright, now that you know everything about YouTube thumbnails, go make one! Tell us in the comments what you’re going to do to make your video thumbnails stand out.</p>
