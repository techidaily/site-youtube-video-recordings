Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed. You can upload videos with 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios to your channel, and the platform support videos in resolutions up to 8K.

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-1"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-1"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-1"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-1"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-1"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-1"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-1"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-1"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-1"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-1"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-1" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed. You can upload videos with 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios to your channel, and the platform support videos in resolutions up to 8K.

In case you don’t have your own audio and video footage you can download videos, music, visual and audio effects from a stock footage website like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmstock effects store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Filmora offers <strong>rich transitions and visual effects libraries</strong> you can use to make the cuts between shot smoother or enhance the colors in the video clips you’re editing. Furthermore, the editor lets you <strong>take snapshots of any frame in video clips</strong> you’ve placed on the timeline in a single click which can be quite useful if you want to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video. Creating the opening titles, end credits or adding different image overlays to a video is a straight forward process since you just have to select the option that fits the style of the video you’re creating and add it to the timeline. Once you’ve completed the video editing process, you can click on the Export button and decide if you want to export a video directly to your YouTube channel or to a destination on your hard drive.</p>

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-2"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-2"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-2"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-2"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-2"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-2"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-2"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-2"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-2"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-2"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-2" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Even the name of the file you’re uploading to your channel should contain a keyword, and once the upload is completed you should add a title, description, and metadata if you would like to increase the video’s visibility on the platform.

In addition, YouTube’s video editor enables you to <strong>add end screens</strong> that last anywhere between five and twenty seconds to your videos, but keep in mind that the video must be at least 25 seconds long to have an end screen. There are a number of fully customizable templates available that can be uses to promote your upcoming videos or to invite viewers to subscribe to your channel.</p>

<p>Becoming a successful YouTuber requires a lot of dedication and hard work, so if at first, you don’t succeed, you should be patient and persistent. In time, as your channel grows, you will be able to monetize your videos, but only if you keep producing new content at a steady pace. Each step of the YouTube creation process is equally important, and you should dedicate an equal amount of attention to recording high-quality footage, editing, and promotion of the content you share on your YouTube channel.

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-3"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-3"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-3"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-3"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-3"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-3"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-3"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-3"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-3"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-3" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>

Even the name of the file you’re uploading to your channel should contain a keyword, and once the upload is completed you should add a title, description, and metadata if you would like to increase the video’s visibility on the platform.

In addition, YouTube’s video editor enables you to <strong>add end screens</strong> that last anywhere between five and twenty seconds to your videos, but keep in mind that the video must be at least 25 seconds long to have an end screen. There are a number of fully customizable templates available that can be uses to promote your upcoming videos or to invite viewers to subscribe to your channel.</p>

                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p>
<p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p>
<p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p>
<h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="2.

                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p>
<p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p>
<p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p>

                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p>
<p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p>
<p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p>
<p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p>
<p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p>

<p>Well designed, packed with advanced features and moderately priced, this gaming headset offers a lot of value to the YouTube crowd. It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p>
<p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Need a gaming headset? The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p>
<p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p>
<p> <strong><a href="#razer">1. Razer Man O’War 7.1</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="#audiotech">2. Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Open Air High Fidelity Headset</a></strong></p>

                      alt="Razer Man O&#39;War 7.1 Headset"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $222.48</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, Mac (with USB), PlayStation, Xbox</p>
<p>This wireless headset has an impressive surround sound engine that allows for an immersive gaming experience and convincing positional audio. The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p>
<p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p>

                      alt="Audio Technica ATH-ADG1 Headset"
                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $299</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4, iPad, iPhone, Xbox (with adapter)</p>
<p>For a gaming headset, this model boasts a really impressive audio quality. This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p>
<p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p>

                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $79.99</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> PC, PS4</p>
<p>Logitec is well known for producing high-quality peripherals, and this model lives up to that standard despite its affordable price. Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p>
<p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p>

                ></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p>
<p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p>
<p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p>

In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p>
<p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $96.77</p>
<p><strong>Compatible with</strong> <strong>:</strong> PC, PS4</p>
<p>If you are looking for the best gaming headset with a microphone, this is a very b candidate. It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p>
<p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> $99.88</p>
<p><strong>Compatible</strong> <strong>with:</strong> PC, Mac, Xbox, PS4, Mobile</p>
<p>Well designed, packed with advanced features and moderately priced, this gaming headset offers a lot of value to the YouTube crowd. It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p>
<p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p>
