That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear "></a>Smartphone Camera Gear <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2 id="Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor"><a href="#Equipment-with-Easy-to-Use-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor"></a>Equipment with Easy-to-Use Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p><em>Check out our most updated guide on this topic: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Equipment Starter Guide For Beginners <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></p><p>The first thing to make sure of before starting a YouTube channel is having all that you need to record and upload high-quality videos regularly.

In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands-2"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands-2" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear-2"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear-2" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear "></a>Smartphone Camera Gear <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera.

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras-3"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio-3"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important.

What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?"></a><strong>1. What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels.

And did you know that subscribe green screen makes it easy to add YouTube Call To Action and direct viewers on what to do?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-1.png"                      alt="subscribe green screen"                ></p><h2 id="Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video-3"><a href="#Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Methods to add a subscribe button to your video"></a>Methods to add a subscribe button to your video</h2><p>Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.</p><h4 id="1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen-3"><a href="#1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen-3" class="headerlink" title="1 Use Subscribe Green Screen"></a>1 Use Subscribe Green Screen</h4><p>Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Set screen</strong><br>You need to create a background at the Studio – and that’s the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png"                      alt="how to make subscribe green screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Adjust lighting</strong><br>Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up the subject</strong><br>Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn’t professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png"                      alt="make your own green screen - set up the object"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Start filming</strong><br>Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.</p><p><strong>Step 5. Polish the rough cut</strong><br>Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.</p><p><strong>Step 6. Key out the footage and edit the green screen</strong><br>Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.</p><p><strong>Step 7. Paste the new background</strong><br>Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.</p><p><strong>Step 8. Add Call To Action</strong><br>Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren’t yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.</p><h4 id="2-Using-YouTube-Studio-3"><a href="#2-Using-YouTube-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="2 Using YouTube Studio"></a>2 Using YouTube Studio</h4><p>You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio.

You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing.

In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep.

The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

Having entertaining and&#x2F;or informative content is the most important thing, but making great videos can only get you so far if people never get a chance to watch them. There are strategies you can use to make sure people get a chance to watch your videos in the first place.</p><p>In this article, we will let you know how to get more views on <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube"></a>10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube</h2><h3 id="1-Be-Searchable"><a href="#1-Be-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Searchable"></a>1. Be Searchable</h3><p>A big part of how to get views on YouTube is making sure people get a chance to watch your videos. People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results. If you want people to get the chance to see your vlog you need to tailor the titles, descriptions, and tags of your videos so that they come up in searches.</p><p>A good way to start is to do a search for your topic and check out how videos that come up first are tagged. This will give you a sense for what keywords you should try to incorporate. For a more in-depth explanation of how you can use your titles, descriptions, and tags to get more views read ‘How To Upload Videos to YouTube’ and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views01.jpg"                      alt="be searchable"                ></p><h3 id="2-Link-Yourself"><a href="#2-Link-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Link Yourself"></a>2. Link Yourself</h3><p>If somebody is watching your video and enjoying it then they will probably welcome the chance to check out similar content. At the end of your videos always include a link to one of your previous videos.

Be Searchable"></a>1. Be Searchable</h3><p>A big part of how to get views on YouTube is making sure people get a chance to watch your videos. People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results. If you want people to get the chance to see your vlog you need to tailor the titles, descriptions, and tags of your videos so that they come up in searches.</p><p>A good way to start is to do a search for your topic and check out how videos that come up first are tagged. This will give you a sense for what keywords you should try to incorporate. For a more in-depth explanation of how you can use your titles, descriptions, and tags to get more views read ‘How To Upload Videos to YouTube’ and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views01.jpg"                      alt="be searchable"                ></p><h3 id="2-Link-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Link-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Link Yourself"></a>2. Link Yourself</h3><p>If somebody is watching your video and enjoying it then they will probably welcome the chance to check out similar content. At the end of your videos always include a link to one of your previous videos. If somebody has watched your video all the way through then they must have liked it, and there is a good chance they will click your link. You can use either YouTube Cards or annotations to redirect viewers to your other videos.</p><p>You do not have to limit yourself to providing links only at the ends of your videos, but you should never include more than three total links in one video. If there are too many then people will start ignoring them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views02.jpg"                      alt="link yourself"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-Playlists-3"><a href="#3-Make-Playlists-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

If somebody likes what they are watching they will probably like watching something similar. The great thing about playlists is that the viewer does not have to take action and click on another of your videos – one just automatically plays when their current video ends. People watching a video on a playlist are more likely to watch multiple videos from that playlist.</p><p>If one of your videos is ranked high on a YouTube search, and that video is also on a playlist, then your playlist will also come up in that same search. This will put your other videos in the path of potential viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playlist-youtube.JPG"                      alt="playlist"                ></p><h3 id="4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive-3"><a href="#4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

How do you get people to subscribe and share your videos? Ask them to.</p><p>People are more likely to subscribe or share if they are prompted to, so make sure to remind viewers to subscribe and share in every video.

Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content.

A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers.

What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers.

What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well. Have a clear call to action somewhere on your website. This is where your viewers become customers.</p><h4 id="But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet-3"><a href="#But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet-3" class="headerlink" title="But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?"></a><strong>But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?</strong></h4><p>While some YouTubers certainly start with their product and service in mind and find their customers to sell through YouTube, many others go the opposite way and discover their audience first.</p><p>Lilly Singh did not start a YouTube channel to sell her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Be-Bawse-Guide-Conquering/dp/0385689306"><em>How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life</em></a>. Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing-3"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-3"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a> <em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing-3"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships-3"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-3"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works-3" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results. This type of independence is what makes YouTube influencer marketing special.</p><h2 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="4-Crowdfunding-3"><a href="#4-Crowdfunding-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-3"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding-3" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-3"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations-3" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target-3"><a href="#Set-a-Target-3" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience.

But have you ever thought about how much YouTube pays or what <strong>YouTube AdSense earnings are?</strong></p><p>If you aren’t sure about the YouTube payment situation or how much AdSense pay for views, you will learn this below. Whether you’re planning to create a channel or already have one, learning how much you can expect YouTube to pay will help you in the longer run.</p><p>Be it AdSense pay on 1,000 views or AdSense pay per click; this blog features information you may appreciate.</p><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Type of Content</a></li><li><a href="#part4-2">Keywords</a></li><li><a href="#part4-3">User Location</a></li><li><a href="#part4-4">Time Requires to Get Views</a></li><li><a href="#part4-5">Video Duration</a></li><li><a href="#part4-6">Your Niche or Industry</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part5">Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-1-000-Views"><a href="#Part-1-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-1-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per 1,000 Views "></a>Part 1: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per 1,000 Views <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-1.jpg"                      alt="adsense pay per 1,000 views"                ></h2><p>As a content creator, you might be tempted to know how much you can expect to earn through AdSense. Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p><h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p><p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p><p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p><h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p><ul><li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li></ul><p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider"><a href="#Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider"></a>Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider</h2><p>After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.</p><h3 id="1-Type-of-Content"><a href="#1-Type-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="1) Type of Content"></a>1) Type of Content</h3><p>To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p><p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p><p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p><p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p><p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg"                      alt="adsense calculator"                ></p><p>And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.</p><h3 id="2-Keywords"><a href="#2-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="2) Keywords"></a>2) Keywords</h3><p>Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product. The ones you choose will help show your ads to users.</p><p>Therefore, go for the relevant yet high-quality keywords and add them to your ad campaigns. This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.</p><h3 id="3-User-Location"><a href="#3-User-Location" class="headerlink" title="3) User Location"></a>3) User Location</h3><p>Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.</p><p>Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.</p><h3 id="4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views"><a href="#4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="4) Time Requires to Get Views"></a>4) Time Requires to Get Views</h3><p>There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.</p><p>The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.</p><p>Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.</p><p>More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.</p><p>And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Duration"><a href="#5-Video-Duration" class="headerlink" title="5) Video Duration"></a>5) Video Duration</h3><p>Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.</p><p>However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.</p><h3 id="6-Your-Niche-or-Industry"><a href="#6-Your-Niche-or-Industry" class="headerlink" title="6) Your Niche or Industry"></a>6) Your Niche or Industry</h3><p>Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings. Some of the profitable topics are:</p><ul><li>Business</li><li>Investment</li><li>Health</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Online Marketing</li></ul><p>You can choose the area that interest you the most and start people educating about it.</p><p>For example, people tend to think about investing their money to multiply it. You can create videos on investment-related topics, tips and tricks to get maximum views.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense"><a href="#Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense"></a>Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense</h2><p>At this point, you’re familiar with almost all aspects of generating money using Google AdSense. And considering the factors, it seems like a task you can perform.</p><p>Before you try earning money via AdSense, consider the following pros and cons.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Google AdSense doesn’t charge an extra fee. It’s a totally free service that can help you earn dollars.</li><li>Don’t know how to make ads? Don’t worry; Google will do it for you.</li><li>It enables you to use one account to monetize multiple websites.</li><li>As a passive income, it doesn’t require additional effort.</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Making the first $100 is a must to get paid further.</li><li>With AdSense, you won’t be allowed to use another ad network.</li><li>A policy breach could make you lose your account.</li><li>You need a lot of traffic to make some serious money.</li><li>Adding several ads can annoy your viewers.</li></ul><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Monetizing your YouTube channel for AdSense is great for having a steady passive income. But, it’s a time-consuming process and has a set of advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>If you already have a YouTube channel and a certain number of views, you can take it further using the provided information. However, focus on factors such as user demographic, content type, and quality to achieve long-term success.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Part 1: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per 1,000 Views <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-1.jpg"                      alt="adsense pay per 1,000 views"                ></p><p>As a content creator, you might be tempted to know how much you can expect to earn through AdSense.

But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p><p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p><p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p><p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p><p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p><p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p><p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p><p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p><h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View-1"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p><p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"                      alt="pay per click"                ></p><p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p><p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p><p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p><h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p><ul><li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li><li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li></ul><p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1"><a href="#Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider"></a>Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider</h2><p>After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.</p><h3 id="1-Type-of-Content-1"><a href="#1-Type-of-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="1) Type of Content"></a>1) Type of Content</h3><p>To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p><p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p><p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p><p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p><p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg"                      alt="adsense calculator"                ></p><p>And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.</p><h3 id="2-Keywords-1"><a href="#2-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="2) Keywords"></a>2) Keywords</h3><p>Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product. The ones you choose will help show your ads to users.</p><p>Therefore, go for the relevant yet high-quality keywords and add them to your ad campaigns. This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.</p><h3 id="3-User-Location-1"><a href="#3-User-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="3) User Location"></a>3) User Location</h3><p>Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.</p><p>Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.</p><h3 id="4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1"><a href="#4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1" class="headerlink" title="4) Time Requires to Get Views"></a>4) Time Requires to Get Views</h3><p>There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.</p><p>The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.</p><p>Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.</p><p>More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.</p><p>And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.</p><h3 id="5-Video-Duration-1"><a href="#5-Video-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="5) Video Duration"></a>5) Video Duration</h3><p>Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.</p><p>However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.</p><h3 id="6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1"><a href="#6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1" class="headerlink" title="6) Your Niche or Industry"></a>6) Your Niche or Industry</h3><p>Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings. Some of the profitable topics are:</p><ul><li>Business</li><li>Investment</li><li>Health</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Online Marketing</li></ul><p>You can choose the area that interest you the most and start people educating about it.</p><p>For example, people tend to think about investing their money to multiply it. You can create videos on investment-related topics, tips and tricks to get maximum views.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense-1"><a href="#Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense"></a>Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense</h2><p>At this point, you’re familiar with almost all aspects of generating money using Google AdSense.

Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8.

Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore.

What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either.

In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family.

If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop.

Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-1"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-1"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-1"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-1"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-1"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-1"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-1"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-2"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-2"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-2"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-2"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-2"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-2"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-2"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-2"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-3"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself-3"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent-3"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-3"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator-3"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-3"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-3"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-3"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment-3"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people <a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does?

Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay!

Can someone tell me how to work on a sports video?”</em></p><p>As I read this query posted on a popular online forum, I realized that so many people out there find it hard to create a sports video. Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important"><a href="#Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is a sports highlight video and why important?"></a>Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</h2><p>As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.</p><p>A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg"                      alt="Sports Highlight Video"                ></p><p>Besides that, if you are applying for a college&#x2F;academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.</p><h2 id="Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences"><a href="#Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences"></a>Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences</h2><p>While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Equipped with several video editing tools, it will let you create a sports highlight video in no time. Since the tool has so many features, you can save your time in editing and come up with a new sports video in minutes.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>Filmora is extremely easy to use and runs on all the leading Windows and macOS versions without any issue.</li><li>Using its inbuilt tools, you can clip out the most important events from a sports video or include them in your highlights.</li><li>There are also features to change the motion and pace of the video (like fast forward or slow motion).</li><li>You can also focus on any athlete and freeze a frame on a particular skill or action.</li><li>Besides that, you can also add voiceovers in your sports highlight video, add media layers, use its inbuilt transitions, and fine-tune the overall aesthetics of your videos.</li><li>There are also tons of filters and presets in Filmora that you can use to save your time in editing.

Once the video is loaded, you can view it on the timeline of the interface. Now, go to the timeline and get the trim tool to manually select the part of the video you wish to trim. After selecting the desired fragment, you can trim the clip or just delete it by clicking on their respective icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-1.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>In the same way, you can also split your video and make other changes in it. You can also include multiple videos together and include them in your timeline as well.</p><p>If you are including multiple videos, then make sure they have the same dimensions and aspect ratio. For this, you can select the video, right-click on the timeline, and click on the crop icon. Now, select the same aspect ratio for the entire video to keep it uniform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>Most of the game highlights that we see have different speeds for various sections.

Though, if you want to focus on some parts and make more changes, then you can use its advanced options as well.</p><p>For instance, in a highlight video, we often wish to freeze certain frames. To do this, just select a frame and use the “Freeze Frame” option from the timeline tools. You can even set the duration to freeze the selected frame.</p><p>If you have included clips from different videos, then you can apply all kinds of transitions from Filmora. In the end, you can go to its edit options and choose to close gaps as well.</p><p>To give your video a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appeal, you can also add different overlays and effects on it from Filmora’s library.</p><p>Lastly, make sure that you added sound or voiceover to your video. You can add a sound from its library or import any other music file to it. Since highlight videos mostly have voiceovers, you add the same by visiting the Record &gt; Record Voiceover option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-4.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format"><a href="#Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export your video in the desired format"></a>Step 4: Export your video in the desired format</h4><p>That’s it!

As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video-1"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>.

With the new updates, it is now easier for beginners to generate revenue on YouTube. The YouTube new monetization policy 2023 makes monetization more accessible to creators. It adds earlier access to the YouTube Partner Program.</p><h3 id="YouTube-New-Policy-for-Monetization-1"><a href="#YouTube-New-Policy-for-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube New Policy for Monetization"></a><strong>YouTube New Policy for Monetization</strong></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-2.JPG"                      alt="updated eligibility criteria"                ></p><p>The new eligibility criteria are more inclusive and require your channel to have:</p><ul><li>At least 500 subscribers</li><li>At least 3 valid public video uploads within the last 90 days</li><li>Either 3,000 public watch hours on long videos in the last 365 days or 3M public views on shorts videos in the last 90 days</li></ul><p>With the new YouTube monetization policy 2023, creators enjoy the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Product promotion through YouTube Shopping</li><li>Fan funding through channel memberships, super chats, super thanks, and super stickers</li><li>Access to Creator Support</li></ul><h3 id="Applicability-of-the-Old-Standards-1"><a href="#Applicability-of-the-Old-Standards-1" class="headerlink" title="Applicability of the Old Standards"></a><strong>Applicability of the Old Standards</strong></h3><p>While the new YouTube monetization criteria create more opportunities for smaller creators to earn fan funding, the <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en&ref_topic=9153642&sjid=15033404818844015570-EU" >old standards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are still applicable. The YouTube policy for monetization through ad revenue will remain the same. Channels are still required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with more than 4,000 public watch hours for long videos in the past 365 days or 10M public views for Shorts videos in the past 90 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-3.JPG"                      alt="updated old standards"                ></p><p>That said, the 2023 new YouTube monetization requirements are a great addition to creators’ journey.

How YouTube’s New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators"></a><strong>Part 3. How YouTube’s New Monetization Policy Will Impact Creators</strong></h2><p>The new monetization rules for YouTube 2023 create a unique opportunity for creators to make money. The requirements to get monetized on YouTube are now relaxed. This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.</p><h3 id="Who-Benefits-the-Most-from-YouTube-Monetization-Rules-2023-1"><a href="#Who-Benefits-the-Most-from-YouTube-Monetization-Rules-2023-1" class="headerlink" title="Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023"></a><strong>Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023</strong></h3><p>Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG"                      alt="shorts revenue sample"                ></p><p>Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.</p><h3 id="New-Policies-Make-YouTube-More-Competitive-1"><a href="#New-Policies-Make-YouTube-More-Competitive-1" class="headerlink" title="New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive"></a><strong>New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive</strong></h3><p>The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.</p><h3 id="Advertisers-to-Benefit-1"><a href="#Advertisers-to-Benefit-1" class="headerlink" title="Advertisers to Benefit"></a><strong>Advertisers to Benefit</strong></h3><p>The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.</p><h3 id="Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels-1"><a href="#Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels-1" class="headerlink" title="Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels"></a><strong>Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels</strong></h3><p>The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.</p><p>It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Getting people to watch them is the next and a much bigger obstacle in your path. Just as a blogger must work hard to get people to read their blog, so a YouTuber needs to find ways to get more views on their videos.</p><p>For any piece of content on the internet, discoverability is key to exposure.

Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title"><a href="#1-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too. We have collected a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to improve your YouTube meta, so check out the suggestions and work forwards from there.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Research your keywords and include high traffic keywords at the start of the title</li><li>Keep titles under 70 characters</li><li>Branding, episode number, and other non-essential info should be at the end of the title</li><li>Review your YouTube titles from time to time and update with new keywords as search trends change</li><li>Avoid clickbait titles or misleading titles as this will affect your view time and subsequently your ranking in search</li></ul><h3 id="2-Description"><a href="#2-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Description"></a>2. Description</h3><p>Your description is a much longer piece of YouTube meta, so you can really go to town with your YouTube keywords here. You’ve got up to 5,000 characters to fill in, and we strongly advise that you aim to use every single one. This really is a golden opportunity, not only to get people motivated to watch all of your video, but also to be indexed correctly through well researched YouTube keywords.</p><p>You may have noticed that, on the search page itself, only a small part of the description actually shows up; 120 characters of it to be precise. This doesn’t affect indexing, but it does mean you have to plan your YouTube description carefully to really hook people into clicking through from just the first sentence or two.</p><p><strong>Best practices</strong></p><ul><li>Make the first sentence or two compelling and captivating to get people to click</li><li>Research the best YouTube keywords to use to ensure your video is correctly indexed</li><li>At the end of your YouTube description, include a call to action to direct viewers on what to do next (subscribe, click through to the website, look at a product, watch more videos, etc.)</li><li>If your video is long, consider placing time codes in your description to help users jump to their areas of interest</li><li>Add links to products showcased, your social channels, or website as you wish</li><li>Don’t forget to credit any music you’ve used here</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Tagging-YouTube-and-Writing-Title-Description" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description"></a>Part 5: Tips for Tagging YouTube and Writing Title, Description</h2><p>So, now we’ve got the basics down, let’s move on to some top tips for getting your metadata just right:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on. For this reason, you should look to update your meta from time to time, at least once every six months or so. Re-research your keywords and optimize for today’s trending search terms.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Take some time to perfect your meta on YouTube and see how many more views it helps you get.

Do not spam</strong></li></ul><p>Irrelevant keywords will not do you any favors in the long run. Using a popular search term such as ‘funny cat’ when actually it’s a video of you unboxing your product will simply irritate your viewers. You’ll get more views, but for shorter durations, and that will hurt not only your ranking but also your reputation. The people you want to draw in with your YouTube meta should be those who are genuinely interested in your videos, as these are the people who will share, comment and interact with you.</p><ul><li><strong>2. Don’t put tags in the description</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube has given you a place to put your tags, and that’s not in the description area of your meta. Placing tags in the description area is known as tag stuffing and can lead to videos being removed or penalized.</p><ul><li><strong>3. Update regularly</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube meta is not a static thing. Trends change, search statistics fluctuate, and the needs of your viewers alter as time goes on. For this reason, you should look to update your meta from time to time, at least once every six months or so. Re-research your keywords and optimize for today’s trending search terms.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube SEO Complete Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Take some time to perfect your meta on YouTube and see how many more views it helps you get.

You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types-2"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types-2" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all.

You need to specify the type of video. In other words, you need to describe your video with keywords. But you might think about why you need to add these words. YouTube can’t figure out what my videos are about? Unfortunately, YouTube can’t though its algorithm is much more advanced than before.</p><p>You must know the competition between videos is furious since <a class="link"   href="https://tubularinsights.com/hours-minute-uploaded-youtube/" >500 hours of video per minute are uploaded on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, don’t be tempted to insert irrelevant tags just because you know they are high traffic. You will be found out and penalized as a result. Just as you did with your description, research your keywords, place the most important ones first and use as many as you can.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types-3"><a href="#What-are-the-three-YouTube-tag-types-3" class="headerlink" title="What are the three YouTube tag types?"></a>What are the three YouTube tag types?</h3><p>YouTube has three different types of tags and each of them has a specific purpose. The tags are-</p><p><strong>Specific</strong> – The specific tag types are keywords-oriented. These keywords specifically pertain to the content of your video. In this tag type, the particular video is highlighted with the keyword tags. Often while typing the keywords in your mind, YouTube suggests phrases and keywords according to the content of your video. You may apply the suggestions and also add more general or common versions of the same keywords.</p><p><strong>Compound</strong> – The compound tags are usually using more than two words. Many a time it is seen that users prefer tagging the complete title of the video. If you are using your video title as the compound tag, ensure that you do not include the prepositions like or, as, and, etc. This is because YouTube allows just 500 characters in the title and ignore the prepositions. It is always advised to use all the 500 characters YouTube has allowed without wasting the characters on prepositions as it will automatically be ignored.</p><p><strong>Generic</strong> – The generic tags are the ones that describe the entire video in one or two words. These tags are used in all the videos of yours. These tags are used across your channel for all the videos you post. It is important to have such general constant tags.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-YouTube-tags-and-optimize-them-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them"></a>Part 2: How to add YouTube tags and optimize them</h2><p>The more relevant tags you add, the better it is. The best part is YouTube doesn’t restrict the number of tags but adding all is not possible and adding something irrelevant doesn’t make sense. So, your YouTube video tags must be the smart ones for more views. Educated tagging is what is required.</p><p>1. <strong>Brand-Specific Tags Addition</strong> - Every business wants their brand name to show up in the search results on YouTube and Google. Self-referencing your video or tagging your brand name in a number of variations is a smart way of letting others know your brand.</p><p>2. <strong>Using YouTube Auto Suggest</strong> – Play with the search option on YouTube and check out the YouTube suggestions when you search. Try to recognize the common videos that pop up while searching for something important and relevant to yours. Try searching for random keywords according to your YouTube search experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-suggest.jpg"                      alt="youtube auto suggest"                ></p><p>3. <strong>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/" >YouTube Keyword Search Tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – Lastly, you may use the YouTube keyword suggestion tool. It helps you to extract the relevant keywords from the videos of your competitors and create suggestions according to the basic term provided by you.</p><p>4. <strong>Use Specific Tags</strong> - After using tools, you need to narrow down your tags specifically, like tags “learn 3D paper cutting”. The search volume may not be huge, but these kinds of tags can let YouTube know your video very well. Give it a try!</p><p>5. <strong>Check competitor’s Tags</strong> - When you check tags from other brands, it is not suggested to copy them all. What you need to do is find what you are missing and try to cover that area. However, only third-party tools can help you do that.

It helps people search for your video, helps YouTube to categorize it correctly and, when done well, can broaden the reach of your content. YouTube meta consists of three main parts: tags, title and description. Here’s how you can use each of these three elements to create powerful metadata for your video:</p><h3 id="1-Title-3"><a href="#1-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Title"></a>1. Title</h3><p>YouTube titles play a big part in the ranking factors for search. That means you’ve got to think about what the people most likely to want to see your video will type into the search bar, as well as the words that accurately describe your video.</p><p>For example, if you have a clip of your cat Fluffy climbing a tree, calling your video ‘Fluffy climbs a tree’ is not the best idea. Nobody knows who Fluffy is; it could be your rabbit, dog, daughter or feather duster for all the YouTube community knows, and nobody is going to be searching for it.</p><p>A better title would be ‘cat climbs a tree, but you could even improve on that. How about ‘funny cat climbs a tree’, which would capture all those people looking for funny cat videos. Or, even better, ‘funny Persian cat climbs a tree’, also capturing those people who adore Persian cats.</p><p>You can see how building awesome YouTube titles can happen organically like this, but it’s also worth doing your homework too.

It is understandable that there will be a learning curve if you just want to get tons of subscribers on your channel – who doesn’t? Ultimately, in getting a standard video that will attract and sustain the interest of the viewers, you will need to employ certain strategies that will enhance your credibility.</p><p>Let’s tell each other the truth, no one wants to watch a video that is not aesthetically appealing even if it is a close friend. So, if you have got the relevant content and the video to pull traffic to your channel, what you will need is editing software that will help you make the correct adjustments to your video</p><p>Nobody wants a random viewer to comment “This video is a little bit tacky, touch-up properly”, that will definitely leave a sting. As such, understand the best technique that works for you as well as the software that meets your needs based on the current level of expertise. It is okay for you to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png"                      alt="advanced%20video%20cutter"                ></p><h2 id="Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have-3"><a href="#Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have-3" class="headerlink" title="Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have"></a>Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have</h2><p>As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.</p><p>However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="1-Control-the-video-duration-3"><a href="#1-Control-the-video-duration-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Control the video duration"></a>1.Control the video duration</h3><p>The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.</p><p>You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important. Consequently, you will be able to sieve through the content and make the appropriate changes while editing the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-change-default-transition-duration.jpg"                                     ></p><h3 id="2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video-3"><a href="#2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Customize the intro and end of the video"></a>2.Customize the intro and end of the video</h3><p>It is possible to grab the attention of the viewer in the intro and even more likely to lose someone once the opening montage comes in. Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best YouTube Banner Size and Channel Art Dimension (The Ultimate Guide) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters-3"><a href="#3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Use Cool transitions or filters"></a>3.Use Cool transitions or filters</h3><p>If there is anything the audience love to see, it is the way you move from different points in the vudeo.

So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so.

That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.</p><h3 id="1-Window-Lighting"><a href="#1-Window-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1.  Window Lighting"></a>1.  Window Lighting</h3><p>The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.</p><p>Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Lighting"                ></p><p>Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel’s past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.</p><h3 id="2-Home-Lighting"><a href="#2-Home-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Home Lighting"></a>2. Home Lighting</h3><p>Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="Mixed Lighting"                ></p><p>Notice how the color of Daniel’s skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).</p><p>Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.</p><p>Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting"><a href="#Part-2-Home-Studio-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Home Studio Lighting"></a>Part 2: Home Studio Lighting</h2><p>If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.</p><h3 id="1-Light-Control"><a href="#1-Light-Control" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Control"></a>1. Light Control</h3><p>The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.</p><h3 id="2-3-Point-Lighting"><a href="#2-3-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. 3-Point Lighting"></a>2. 3-Point Lighting</h3><p>The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt="3-Point Lighting"                ></p><p>Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.</p><p>To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.</p><p>Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.</p><h3 id="3-4-Point-Lighting"><a href="#3-4-Point-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. 4-Point Lighting"></a>3. 4-Point Lighting</h3><p>As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.</p><p>What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.</p><p>For more information on lighting equipment, check out my <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-17-video-lighting-equipment-for-youtubers-440.html" >Top 17 Video Lighting Equipment For YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Touch-Up-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel.

If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content.

Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have.

Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow.

You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like.

If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition-2"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-2"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory-2"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-3"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important.

This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like.

Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance-1"><a href="#Content-Relevance-1" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility-1"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.</p><h3 id="Editing-1"><a href="#Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p>If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a <strong>green screen background for YouTube videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1"><a href="#5-Winter-YouTube-Background-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas"></a><strong>5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas</strong></h2><p>It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><ul><li><p>Snowy Landscape <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-1.png"                      alt="snowy landscape youtube background"                ></p></li><li><p>Festive Holiday Decor <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-2.png"                      alt="festive holiday decor image"                ></p></li><li><p>Cozy Indoor Settings <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-3.png"                      alt="cozy indoor winter background"                ></p></li><li><p>Winter Cityscapes <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-4.png"                      alt="winter cityscapes background"                ></p></li><li><p>Animated Winter Scenes <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-5.png"                      alt="animated winter scenes background"                ></p></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-or-Source-Winter-Backgrounds-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds"></a>How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds</h2><p>If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.</p><p>Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter <strong>background for YouTube</strong> in no time.</p><h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Download and install the Filmora video editing tool.</p><h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Run the program and click on <strong>“</strong>New Project”.

In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.</p><p>• Check your extensions<br>One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows?

action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They’re heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you’re doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they’re small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera’s 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube’s battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos</em> <em>- Multiple mounting options</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Low-quality built-in microphone</em> <em>- No preview screen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png"                      alt="Yi 4K"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19” LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera’s 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera’s high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Weighs only 3.4 Oz</em> <em>- Powerful electronic image stabilization</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited mounting capabilities</em> <em>- The camera’s fisheye lens can distort footage</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png"                      alt="Nikon B500"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon’s Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500’s ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera’s 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn’t have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn’t have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Great connectivity features</em> <em>- 80x optical zoom</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No manual exposure controls</em> <em>- Limited ISO sensitivity</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png"                      alt="Nikon A900"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f&#x2F;3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- 4K and Full HD video recording options</em> <em>- Manual exposure control</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited audio recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png"                      alt="Sony a5100"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony’s a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- AF speeds exceed all expectations</em> <em>- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Fake shutter sounds</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> supports most video formats that you can find.

action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They’re heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you’re doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they’re small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera’s 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube’s battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos</em> <em>- Multiple mounting options</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Low-quality built-in microphone</em> <em>- No preview screen</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png"                      alt="Yi 4K"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19” LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera’s 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera’s high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Weighs only 3.4 Oz</em> <em>- Powerful electronic image stabilization</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited mounting capabilities</em> <em>- The camera’s fisheye lens can distort footage</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png"                      alt="Nikon B500"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon’s Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500’s ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera’s 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn’t have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn’t have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries.

The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f&#x2F;3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- 4K and Full HD video recording options</em> <em>- Manual exposure control</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited audio recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png"                      alt="Sony a5100"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony’s a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- AF speeds exceed all expectations</em> <em>- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Fake shutter sounds</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> supports most video formats that you can find.

The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera’s 4.35V lithium-ion battery.

The Nikon Coolpix B500’s ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera’s 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps.

Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording.

The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus.

Like the B500, the A900’s ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200. Consequently, this camera won’t be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- 4K and Full HD video recording options</em> <em>- Manual exposure control</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Limited audio recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png"                      alt="Sony a5100"                ></td><td>Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony’s a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony’s E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- AF speeds exceed all expectations</em> <em>- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact</em> <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Fake shutter sounds</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> supports most video formats that you can find.

Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks.

Take a Snapshot as the Thumbnail with Filmora</strong></p><p>Step1 Open the video in the timeline, <strong>click</strong> the play icon in the player window, and <strong>pause</strong> when you reach the desired frame for the YouTube thumbnail. <strong>Click</strong> the camera icon to take a snapshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-open-video.jpg"                      alt="filmora open video"                ></p><p>Step2 In the snapshot window, <strong>choose</strong> to <strong>save</strong> the snapshot as a PNG or JPG file.</p><p>Step3 Select the output storage location and <strong>click OK</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-save-snapshot.jpg"                      alt="filmora save snapshot"                ></p><p><strong>2. Resize the YouTube Thumbnail</strong></p><p>Step1 Import the image into the app timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"                      alt="filmora import snapshot"                ></p><p>Step2 Drag and drop the image into the timeline and <strong>click</strong> the green “<strong>Export</strong>“ button. In the popup Export window, select <strong>GIF</strong>. Next, click “<strong>Settings</strong>“ to adjust the resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-adjust-gif-settings.jpg"                      alt="adjust filmora export settings"                ></p><p>Step3 As the recommended size of a YouTube Thumbnail is 1280 * 720 pixels, you can set the resolution to 1280 * 720. Then click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> the GIF. You can now upload the GIF thumbnail to your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-adjust-resolution.JPG"                      alt="filmora adjust resolution"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Convert-Images-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Third-Party-Software-1"><a href="#Method-4-Convert-Images-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Third-Party-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software"></a>Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software</h3><p>In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails. Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method. In this section, we’ll consider factors such as ease of use, speed, quality, cost, and compatibility to help you determine the best option for your needs.</p><p>Take a look at the table below for a more detailed comparison.</p><p>| |  <strong>Windows Default App</strong>                         | <strong>Online YouTube Thumbnail Size Converter</strong> | <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> | <strong>Third-Party Software</strong> |          |<br>| ————————————————– | ——————————————- | ———————– | ———————— | ——– |<br>| <strong>Other Software Required or Not</strong>                 | No                                          | Yes (Internet Browser)  | Yes                      | Yes      |<br>| <strong>Internet Connection Required</strong>                   | No                                          | Yes                     | No                       | No       |<br>| <strong>Complexity of Operations</strong>                       | Easy                                        | Easy                    | Easy                     | Moderate |<br>| <strong>Support Other Editing of the YouTube Thumbnail</strong> | No                                          | No                      | Yes                      | Yes      |<br>| <strong>File Size Limit</strong>                                | None                                        | 25MB                    | None                     | None     |</p><p>Resizing YouTube thumbnails using the Windows default app is a quick and easy method that requires no additional software or tools. However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP. Each method has advantages and disadvantages; the best one depends on your specific needs and preferences.

It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>. To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p><h3 id="1-DEVUMI"><a href="#1-DEVUMI" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p>_ <a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews"><a href="#2-BuyViews" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p>_ <a class="link"   href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p><h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p>_ <a class="link"   href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p><h3 id="4-500VIEWS"><a href="#4-500VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On _ <a class="link"   href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p><h3 id="5-Social-Shop"><a href="#5-Social-Shop" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think?

Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-1"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-1" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources.

It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-2"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-2" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one).

DEVUMI</h3><p>_ <a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews-2"><a href="#2-BuyViews-2" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2.

On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p><h3 id="4-500VIEWS-2"><a href="#4-500VIEWS-2" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On _ <a class="link"   href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _ you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites.

Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-2"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-2" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-2"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-2" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube.

Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently.

Due to user demand for more recognition of smaller channels, YouTube also introduced reward levels for channels that are still growing. These lower levels don’t come with trophies, but creators who reach them should feel proud.</p><p>Here are all of YouTube’s levels, from small to big:</p><h2 id="Benefit-levels"><a href="#Benefit-levels" class="headerlink" title="Benefit levels"></a>Benefit levels</h2><p><a href="#graphite">1.

As soon as you start a YouTube channel, you will already be on this level until you get up to 1K subscribers. During this time, you should focus on learning how YouTube works and perfecting your video production and editing skills. If your YouTube Channel subscriber is over 100, then you will be allowed to custom the URL of your channel. For more information about Custom Channel URL, please read: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Find and Change Your YouTube Channel URL – Super Easy! &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Opal-Level-1000-10K-subscribers"><a href="#2-Opal-Level-1000-10K-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#2: Opal Level (1000-10K subscribers)"></a><strong>#2: Opal Level (1000-10K subscribers)</strong></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/YouTube-Creator-Award.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-opal-level"                ></p><p>After you get your first thousand subscribers on your YouTube channel, you will be on the Opal Level. This is one of the three requirements for getting access to the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Partner Program for monetization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. By this point, you’ll have started to develop your own style and build a personal brand. This is the time to start networking with other YouTubers and trying to find collaboration partners.</p><h3 id="3-Bronze-Level-10K-100K-subscribers"><a href="#3-Bronze-Level-10K-100K-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#3: Bronze Level (10K-100K subscribers)"></a><strong>#3: Bronze Level (10K-100K subscribers)</strong></h3><p>Getting ten thousand subscribers is a big deal. By this point, you have enough of a following that they could be called a fanbase, and you can start leveraging your platform to make money through AdSense. Once you pass 10K subscribers, it starts to become easier to find brand deals and sponsorships too. YouTube will offer an additional option of Teespring for the monetized channel at this level.</p><h2 id="Awards-Level-1"><a href="#Awards-Level-1" class="headerlink" title="Awards Level"></a>Awards Level</h2><p>When a verified YouTube channel reaches a specific milestone and is deemed eligible for a creator award, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in a metal casing with a YouTube play button symbol.</p><h3 id="4-The-Silver-Creator-Award-100K-1-million-subscribers"><a href="#4-The-Silver-Creator-Award-100K-1-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#4: The Silver Creator Award (100K-1 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silver-creator-award.jpg"                      alt="silver creator award"                ></strong></p><p>This is the first level that comes with a trophy. YouTubers with a Silver Play Button probably won’t be earning enough money from YouTube to support themselves, but they’re in a good position to start going after more lucrative brand deals. Creators at this level may be earning enough to invest in some better camera gear. Channels at this level are also eligible to apply for a digital verification badge.</p><h3 id="5-The-Gold-Creator-Award-1-million-10-million-subscribers"><a href="#5-The-Gold-Creator-Award-1-million-10-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-award-gold-plaque.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-gold-level"                ></strong></p><p><em>If people mean graphite when they say ‘lead,’ and alchemists turn lead into gold, then is YouTube really about alchemy?</em></p><p>At this level, you’re making money. When you first reach 1 million, it may still not be enough to live off of, but you’re getting close to being able to make YouTube your job (which you will probably be able to do before leaving the Gold Level). Things like your own makeup line or a book deal are not out of the question at this point.</p><h3 id="6-The-Diamond-Creator-Award-10-million-50-million-subscribers"><a href="#6-The-Diamond-Creator-Award-10-million-50-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-awards-diamond.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-diamond-level"                ></p><p>You’re a YouTube star. You’ve made it. You’re making enough money that YouTube&#x2F;projects spawned from your YouTube channel support you completely, and you’ve probably got a team of helpers. Expect to be going on tours to meet and perform for your fans’ live. Also, if you didn’t have a book deal before, you almost definitely have one now.</p><h2 id="Super-High-Level-1"><a href="#Super-High-Level-1" class="headerlink" title="Super High Level"></a>Super High Level</h2><p>The awards in these levels are absent from the Creator Awards page. Only a handful of channels achieved these levels.</p><h3 id="7-The-Custom-Creator-Award-50-million-subscribers"><a href="#7-The-Custom-Creator-Award-50-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#7: The Custom Creator Award (50 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#7: The Custom Creator Award (50 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pewdiepie-custom-creator-award.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-diamond-level"                ></strong></p><p>For channels whose subscribers are over 50 million, PewDiePie is the first person to ever receive this reward. It was made by the shape of his channel logo, a fist bump. He nicknamed this custom play button the Ruby Play Button. If you manage to reach this level, you are beyond being a star on YouTube and are now a bonafide pop culture phenomenon.</p><h3 id="8-The-Red-Diamond-Creator-Award-100-million-subscribers"><a href="#8-The-Red-Diamond-Creator-Award-100-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#8: The Red Diamond Creator Award (100 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#8: The Red Diamond Creator Award (100 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-diamond-creator-award.jpg"                      alt="red diamond creator award"                ></strong></p><p>The play button at this level features a play button triangle with a large dark red crystal. If you are able to obtain the award at this level, monetization should never be for you to worry about. One hundred million subscribers mean that 1.3% of the people on this planet are watching you. You’d be a legend if you made it. As of August 2020, only PewDiePie and T-series have obtained this award.</p><p>Click here to check out the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >5 most subscribed YouTubers. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Welp.
