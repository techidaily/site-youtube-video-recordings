If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site.

Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC.

ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068439/7443" target="_top" id="2068439">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068439" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068439/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s-3"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos-1"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large.

YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it.

Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123733/7443" target="_top" id="2123733">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123733" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123733/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-2"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938745/19272" target="_top" id="1938745">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938745" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938745/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137205/26400" target="_top" id="2137205">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137205" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137205/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148774/18498" target="_top" id="2148774">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148774" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148774/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137394/7443" target="_top" id="2137394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528685/16446" target="_top" id="1528685">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528685" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528685/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). Otherwise,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >Fortnite Battle Royale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is free and available on almost every major platform: PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Product Brand  Epic Games</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>PC Minimum Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel HD 4000</li><li>PC Recommended Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core Core i5 2.8 Ghz, Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Mac Minimum Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel Iris Pro 5200</li><li>Mac Recommended Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i5 2.8 Ghz,Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Platforms  PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch</li><li>Languages Supported  English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), Turkish</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-the-leading-films-hidden-cinema-treasures/"><u>[Updated] Beyond the Leading Films Hidden Cinema Treasures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-interactive-image-merging-for-desktop-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] Interactive Image Merging for Desktop Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/ai-driven-bing-unveiled-by-microsoft/"><u>AI-Driven Bing Unveiled by Microsoft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/broadview-networks-navigating-mcn-choices/"><u>Broadview Networks Navigating MCN Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-downloading-and-updating-hp-network-card-drivers-for-multiple-windows-versions/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Downloading and Updating HP Network Card Drivers for Multiple Windows Versions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/elevating-income-with-mobile-video-monetization-techniques-for-youtubers/"><u>Elevating Income with Mobile Video Monetization Techniques for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-when-apple-account-locked-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix when Apple Account Locked On Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/mastering-recording-secrets-for-top-notch-audio/"><u>Mastering Recording Secrets for Top-Notch Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/maxs-pick-top-documentary-films-of-july-2024-you-dont-want-to-miss/"><u>Max's Pick: Top Documentary Films of July 2024 You Don’t Want to Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/online-troubleshooting-guide-restoring-your-origin-connectivity/"><u>Online Troubleshooting Guide: Restoring Your Origin Connectivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/the-dynamic-duo-approach-using-two-photos-in-one-instagram-story-for-2024/"><u>The Dynamic Duo Approach Using Two Photos in One Instagram Story for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/understanding-and-utilizing-igtv-for-enhanced-engagement-for-2024/"><u>Understanding and Utilizing IGTV for Enhanced Engagement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-convert-video-voice-to-text-online-for-free/"><u>Updated In 2024, How To Convert Video Voice to Text Online for Free?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re looking for a light therapy alarm clock with all of the bells and whistles, look no further. The Philips Somneo Wake-Up Light Alarm Clock is a frontrunner in the light therapy alarm clock market, coming with little perks like breathing exercises to help you wind down before bedtime and a charging port to keep your phone topped up while you rest. It’s one of the most costly light therapy alarm clocks, but if you want a bedside companion that doesn’t have any compromises, the Somneo is the one to get.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VDEjoFnc3QJe7b75UbUe2AdUIqE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4137028-1-1-5c8fee2ac9e77c0001ac18e6.jpg" alt="Philips Somneo HF3650/60 Sleep and Wake-Up Light Therapy Lamp"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Setup-Very-user-friendly-if-oddly-shaped"><a href="#Design-and-Setup-Very-user-friendly-if-oddly-shaped" class="headerlink" title="Design and Setup: Very user-friendly, if oddly shaped"></a><strong>Design and Setup: Very user-friendly, if oddly shaped</strong></h2><p> At 12 inches in diameter, 8.8 inches wide, and weighing 3.2 pounds, the Somneo is one of the larger and heavier clocks to grace a bedside table. Its shape is odd as well. Most light therapy clocks put the time interface in the center and the light circles around this. The Somneo, however, retains this shape, but places a hole in the center and the time interface at the bottom. It’s odd, but not objectionable, making the Somneo look more like a modern designer piece than your standard bedside light.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/idFMYxSvr4WNKHfmtginjcQrPy4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4137028-1-2-5c8fee3dc9e77c0001a926f6.jpg" alt="Philips Somneo HF3650/60 Sleep and Wake-Up Light Therapy Lamp"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> A quick note: the interface itself is easy to read, and adjusts to the room’s ambient light. The clock’s home interface is easy to navigate as well. It comes with a number of simple touch-activated buttons including a light switch, an FM radio feature, and the previously mentioned wind down option.</p><p> The unique feature about the Philips Somneo is that it offers a “wind down” feature, which includes both a sunset simulation and breathing exercises.</p><p> On the back, the Somneo has a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you can charge your phone as well as a 3.5mm audio jack, which is nice if you want to listen to your phone’s music through a speaker. Perhaps its best feature is that the Somneo isn’t completely reliant on wired power — in the event of a power outage it has enough backup for eight hours and will beep for one minute if it knows that it will not last until the next alarm time.</p><p> See Just How Well These Light Therapy Alarm Clocks Glow</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-to-build-but-not-so-easy-to-configure"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-to-build-but-not-so-easy-to-configure" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy to build, but not so easy to configure"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy to build, but not so easy to configure</strong></h2><p> The Somneo comes with three components: the clock, an AC adapter, charging cable, and an auxiliary cord. To set it up, we simply plugged the adapter and the charging cable into the clock, and plugged the adapter into the wall.</p><p> Setting up the clock, however, was a little more tedious The Somneo started by asking us to set the time. A couple of taps, and the time was set. However, it wanted us to go into the deeper settings immediately before reaching the home screen: brightness levels for the alarm, the time, the sounds and volumes, and breathing exercise routines. If you don’t read through the instructions or know it comes with a wind-down breathing feature, you’ll be confused as to why you need to decide whether you want to breathe four times per minute versus six.</p><p> The Philips Somneo is a top-tier product in the light therapy alarm clock market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972679/19272" target="_top" id="1972679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-Great-for-falling-asleep"><a href="#Features-Great-for-falling-asleep" class="headerlink" title="Features: Great for falling asleep"></a><strong>Features: Great for falling asleep</strong></h2><p> The unique feature about the Philips Somneo is that it offers a “wind down” feature, which includes both a sunset simulation and breathing exercises. Simply tap the wind down button, and then tap the sunset option, and the light slowly diminishes from a bright yellow hue, morphing to oranges and reds before it completely turns off. We like that the lights don’t suddenly switch off at the beginning and end — every light-related feature with the Somneo gradually fades and brightens.</p><p> This feature also comes into play during breathing exercises, as it brightens as you breathe in and fades as you breathe out. If you want the light to stay on, you can use it in lamp mode to let it double as a night light or a bedside lamp. There are 25 brightness levels, but we noticed that while the Somneo is a great nightlight, the high brightness wasn’t quite good enough to be a lamp. You can read from it, but it’s just not an optimal bedside light.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047351/19272" target="_top" id="2047351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Waking-up-It’s-a-breeze"><a href="#Waking-up-It’s-a-breeze" class="headerlink" title="Waking up: It’s a breeze"></a><strong>Waking up: It’s a breeze</strong></h2><p> As we discovered the next morning, the same gradual light changes are available for the morning alarm. The light didn’t pop on, but gradually brightened. The Somneo ended up waking us up naturally a few minutes before the audio alarm sounded. It offers seven different audio options for the alarm itself, ranging from birdsong to soft gongs, but not your own phone’s tunes.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-Y5_OBcQ3E4zZLKBd4JYJ2fDj04=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4137028-1-5-5c8fee6ac9e77c0001eb1c8d.jpg" alt="Philips Somneo HF3650/60 Sleep and Wake-Up Light Therapy Lamp"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> Snoozing the alarm clock is very easy, too. Simply tap the top of the alarm clock, and the light will stay on while the music stops playing for nine minutes. To turn off the alarm, we simply pressed the alarm button on the interface, the music stopped playing, and the light gradually faded away.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VnTu8-OX_dmaMQft3divUMJaMm0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4137028-1-4-5c8fee5b46e0fb000172f0a4.jpg" alt="Philips Somneo HF3650/60 Sleep and Wake-Up Light Therapy Lamp"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Radio-An-extra-convenience"><a href="#Radio-An-extra-convenience" class="headerlink" title="Radio: An extra convenience"></a><strong>Radio: An extra convenience</strong></h2><p> Because the audio is superb, we thoroughly tested the radio feature. The user can preset five radio stations, and can easily control swapping between them. We couldn’t flip back and forth between the options, but rather cycled through the other stations before coming back to the original. There is a volume section under the FM radio where you can easily increase or decrease it, though it was confusing to find at first. Once you become familiarized with it, though, it’s simple to maneuver.</p><h2 id="Price-Top-end-for-high-end-products"><a href="#Price-Top-end-for-high-end-products" class="headerlink" title="Price: Top end for high-end products"></a><strong>Price: Top end for high-end products</strong></h2><p> At $199.99, the Somneo is priced on the high-end for light therapy alarm clocks. However, you get what you pay for: great audio quality, gradual, subtle light changes, and more alarm options than most clocks on the market. We especially liked the radio preset feature as well as the auxiliary option for phone playback — an extra option nearly all other light therapy clocks lack. While pricey, the Somneo really boasts all the bells and whistles you may want or need.</p><h2 id="Philips-Somneo-vs-Philips-HF3520-Wake-Up-Light"><a href="#Philips-Somneo-vs-Philips-HF3520-Wake-Up-Light" class="headerlink" title="Philips Somneo vs. Philips HF3520 Wake-Up Light"></a><strong>Philips Somneo vs. Philips HF3520 Wake-Up Light</strong></h2><p> Compared to its cheaper sibling, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/philips-hf3520-light-therapy-alarm-clock-review-4589352" >Philips HF3520 Wake-Up Light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Philips Somneo’s extra features set it apart. Unlike the HF3520, the Somneo offers the breathing exercises, USB phone charging port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. However, the HF3520 has a lower price with many similar options, like five alarms with solid audio quality, and the same gradual light brightening and fading. The HF3520 similarly has a wind-down option, but not any USB or auxiliary ports. If relaxing before bed and charging a phone is a necessity for you, invest in the Somneo, otherwise, the HF3520 can save you some money.</p><p> Still want to browse some other options?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144280/7443" target="_top" id="2144280">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144280" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144280/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market. Indeed, at that price, it’s the least expensive one we tested, yet no part of it feels like any corners were cut in terms of quality or performance.</p><p> At that price point, it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><h2 id="Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme"><a href="#Competition-In-the-battle-of-the-smallest-this-one-reigns-supreme" class="headerlink" title="Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme"></a><strong>Competition: In the battle of the smallest, this one reigns supreme</strong></h2><p><strong><em>DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter:</em></strong>  When it comes down to it these two units are surprisingly similar, down to the case and overall design of the unit. If you really want the ability to use your jump starter to also charge your laptop the DBPOWER is worth a look.

They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1521325/16446" target="_top" id="1521325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1521325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1521325/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.
