If you are puzzled about how ASMR video works, maybe today’s article can aid you in this.</p><p>So, let us know ASMR meaning and all about it. The term ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) might sound technical, but the fact is there is no science or research behind the concept. They are sensation videos that create a tingling feeling making one feel relaxed and feeling asleep.

However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving. Having better data and understanding of how an individual video or an entire channel is performing will help creators succeed on this ever more competitive platform.</p><p><em>Have you tried the new YouTube Studio (Beta)?

If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis-3"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel-3"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources-3"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them?

Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:</p><h4 id="Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer"><a href="#Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer"></a>Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer</h4><p>As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers’ mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly"><a href="#Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly"></a>Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</h4><p>Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience"></a>Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</h4><p>It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><p>Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram.

Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>.

This type of content can offer immense benefits to both influencers and small retail businesses.</p><p>Though they may not be quite as existent as they once were, it’s still essential to know the potential effect of these try-on-haul videos. They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience. Here’s a quick guide to learn the ins and outs of haul videos.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is a Haul Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why is Haul Videos Popular?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Get Inspired from Fashion YouTubers to Find Out the Point of Try on Hauls</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Make a Catchy Haul Video?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Haul-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Haul-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Haul Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is a Haul Video?</strong></h2><p>Generally, a haul video is a recording of someone showcasing a collection of purchases. They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.</p><p>Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006&#x2F;2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn’t that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.</p><p>Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?"></a><strong>Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?</strong></h2><p>Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.</p><p>They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.</p><p>So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.</p><p>On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience.

Make sure that you’re comfortable presenting in front of a camera.</p><p>Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple “Hello, everyone!”), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.</p><p>Act as if you’re directly conversing with one of your friends – it’s one of the comfy tricks you can follow.

They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience.

They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.</p><p>Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006&#x2F;2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn’t that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.</p><p>Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-1"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?"></a><strong>Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?</strong></h2><p>Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.</p><p>They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.</p><p>So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.</p><p>On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience. If you have a YouTube channel, Instagram account, Facebook page, or blog, providing insights on the products you love can help your audience shape their own purchasing decisions.</p><p>It also creates a natural way to infuse some brand-related content into your content creation strategy.

Create a good setup"></a>1. Create a good setup</h3><p>Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.</p><h3 id="2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-2"><a href="#2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.</p><p>You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.</p><h3 id="3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-2"><a href="#3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Speak clearly and perform better"></a>3. Speak clearly and perform better</h3><p>Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don’t want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you’re comfortable presenting in front of a camera.</p><p>Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple “Hello, everyone!”), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.</p><p>Act as if you’re directly conversing with one of your friends – it’s one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.</p><h3 id="4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-2"><a href="#4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s a great way of showcasing your followers and subscribers your personal style, how you shop and what your favorite stores are. Keeping in mind the mantras used by famous haul video creators, we’ve gathered a step-by-step guide below using which you can instantly create a catchy try-on haul video.</p><h3 id="1-Create-a-good-setup-3"><a href="#1-Create-a-good-setup-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a good setup"></a>1. Create a good setup</h3><p>Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.</p><h3 id="2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-3"><a href="#2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment"></a>2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment</h3><p>Put your camera on a flat surface if available. You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.</p><p>You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.</p><h3 id="3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-3"><a href="#3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Speak clearly and perform better"></a>3. Speak clearly and perform better</h3><p>Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don’t want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you’re comfortable presenting in front of a camera.</p><p>Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple “Hello, everyone!”), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.</p><p>Act as if you’re directly conversing with one of your friends – it’s one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.</p><h3 id="4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-3"><a href="#4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can also describe why you purchased each item, the price, plus any special discounts. Moreover, it is a great idea to keep all of your receipts and bills.</p><h3 id="5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor-3"><a href="#5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

In excitement, you’d want to upload it as quickly as you can, but it’s better to invest a little time editing it so that you can publish a video with superb quality.</p><p>If there are any sections in your video that you don’t look for in the finished product, you can remove them. Plus, you can add special effects such as floating text and captions. All of this can be instantly done with the beginner-friendly and popular video editing program by Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>Within the new era of Filmora! Wondershare Filmora X is here with features like keyframing, motion tracking, audio ducking, and more.

There are four main elements; lighting, beauty supplies, backgrounds, and audio. Here are some tips on building your beauty guru set:</p><h4 id="1-Light-It-Up"><a href="#1-Light-It-Up" class="headerlink" title="1. Light It Up"></a>1.

Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.</p><p>Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.</p><p><strong>Using a Window:</strong>  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.</p><p><strong>Using a Ring Light:</strong>  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.</p><p>Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.</p><p>Check this tutorial to know more details:</p><h4 id="2-Organize-Your-Makeup"><a href="#2-Organize-Your-Makeup" class="headerlink" title="2.

Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.</p><h4 id="3-Alter-Your-Background"><a href="#3-Alter-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="3.

You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.</p><p>Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.</p><h4 id="4-Be-Audible"><a href="#4-Be-Audible" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Audible"></a>4. Be Audible</h4><p>You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”.</p><p>If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Beauty Vlogs are some of the most popular channels on YouTube.

Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.</p><p>Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.</p><p><strong>Using a Window:</strong>  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.</p><p><strong>Using a Ring Light:</strong>  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.</p><p>Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.</p><p>Check this tutorial to know more details:</p><h4 id="2-Organize-Your-Makeup-3"><a href="#2-Organize-Your-Makeup-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize Your Makeup"></a>2. Organize Your Makeup</h4><p>Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.</p><h4 id="3-Alter-Your-Background-3"><a href="#3-Alter-Your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Alter Your Background"></a>3. Alter Your Background</h4><p>Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.</p><p>Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.</p><h4 id="4-Be-Audible-3"><a href="#4-Be-Audible-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Audible"></a>4. Be Audible</h4><p>You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”.</p><p>If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Are-You-Sure-About-Using-Subforsub-to-Grow-Your-YouTube-Audience"><a href="#Are-You-Sure-About-Using-Subforsub-to-Grow-Your-YouTube-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Are You Sure About Using Subforsub to Grow Your YouTube Audience?"></a>Are You Sure About Using Subforsub to Grow Your YouTube Audience?</h2><h5 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality Video - Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy and powerful YouTube video editor</p><p>Numerous video and audio effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube streaming service is a beehive of activities.

Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.</p><p>Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:</p><h2 id="Sponsorships"><a href="#Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorships"></a>Sponsorships</h2><p>If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?</p><p>There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.</p><p>Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.</p><p>Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.</p><p>Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers. You should let them know that you have a sponsor, and then incorporate the branded content in ways that do not take away from their enjoyment of your videos.</p><h2 id="Ad-Revenue"><a href="#Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Ad Revenue"></a>Ad Revenue</h2><p>Monetizing your videos and earning ad revenue is one of the primary ways beauty vloggers, and all other YouTubers, make money. It takes a long time to earn more than the pocket change from ads, but so long as you keep growing your audience your revenue will keep going up.</p><p>Pay attention to the estimated revenue reports to see which of your videos are earning the most money from ads (they won’t always be your most popular videos). By making more videos on similar topics you will be able to make more money.</p><h2 id="Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Links"></a>Affiliate Links</h2><p>By becoming an Amazon affiliate, or joining the affiliate program of another online store, you can make money by including links to products in the descriptions of your video or in your related blog posts.</p><p>For example, if you talk about your new curling iron in a hair tutorial then you can include a special link to it on Amazon. If any of your viewers follow that link and buy it, you earn a percentage of the purchase.</p><p>Even better – if that person keeps shopping, or even skips the curling iron and buys something else, you earn a percentage of any purchase they make on Amazon for a certain period of time.</p><p>Affiliate links are mostly used by bloggers, not YouTubers, but you can still include them in the descriptions of your videos (not YouTube Cards or annotations though). It is not a bad idea for you to create blog posts to accompany your videos and post your affiliate links. Blogs are a great way to generate traffic to your videos.</p><h2 id="Gifts"><a href="#Gifts" class="headerlink" title="Gifts"></a>Gifts</h2><p>Sometimes companies might just give you stuff.</p><p>As your following gets bigger, brands might start sending you samples of their products in the hopes that you will fall in love with them and mention, review, or use them in your videos. This is not the same as a sponsorship because the brand is not paying you for a specific kind of message.</p><p>Receiving these kinds of gifts is not the same as getting paid, but it can certainly save you money on makeup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Nov 01, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>There are a lot of ways you can make money by posting makeup, beauty, or fashion videos on YouTube.

Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files.

In certain instances, a good YouTube presence could make or break a business or budding entertainment sensation.</p><p>Those with high YouTube rankings typically yield more returns from the said venue. Luckily, users might increase these vital statistics by paying close attention to several factors that affect YouTube video ranking.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p><a href="#part1">Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking</a></p><p><a href="#part2">Top 8 YouTube Rank Tracker</a></p><h2 id="Factors-that-Affect-YouTube-Video-Ranking"><a href="#Factors-that-Affect-YouTube-Video-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking"></a>Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking</h2><p>If you are a YouTuber, you have to understand how videos rank higher. In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.</p><h4 id="Video-Title"><a href="#Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking"                ></p><p>YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views.

Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.</p><p>On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description-3"><a href="#Video-Description-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality-3"><a href="#Video-Quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill.

If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.</p><p>For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.</p><h4 id="3-Credibility"><a href="#3-Credibility" class="headerlink" title="3.

Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.</p><p>While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?</p><p>If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.</p><h4 id="What-Do-People-Know-You-For"><a href="#What-Do-People-Know-You-For" class="headerlink" title="What Do People Know You For?"></a><strong>What Do People Know You For?</strong></h4><p>If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?</p><p>If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.</p><p>Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:</p><p>- Can I teach people what I know?</p><p>- Will I want to learn more about this topic?</p><p>- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?</p><p>Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?"></a><strong>What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?</strong></h4><p>If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.</p><p>When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:</p><p>- Educate</p><p>- Entertain</p><p>- Inspire</p><h4 id="Educate-Your-Audience"><a href="#Educate-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Educate Your Audience"></a><strong>Educate Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question.

(example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)</p><h4 id="Entertain-Your-Audience"><a href="#Entertain-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Entertain Your Audience"></a><strong>Entertain Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)</p><p>Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic.

Discoverability"></a><strong>1. Discoverability</strong></h4><p>Having a niche differentiates your channel from all the other ones on YouTube. There is no denying the crowded space on the video platform. Every minute, <a class="link"   href="https://merchdope.com/youtube-statistics/" >300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you were simply copying other YouTubers, it will be challenging to grow, as your content will be in the shadows of all the other ones.</p><h4 id="2-Consistency-3"><a href="#2-Consistency-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistency"></a><strong>2. Consistency</strong></h4><p>By having a consistent niche, your channel will be more coherent for those who discovered your awesome content and wants more related videos. If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.</p><p>For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.</p><h4 id="3-Credibility-3"><a href="#3-Credibility-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Do you want to fuel a passion? Do you want to educate the masses?</p><p>Your intentions on YouTube can be a numbers game: you want to get views, subscribers, and make money.</p><p>Or perhaps your intentions on YouTube can be to make content for a specific audience so that you can build a community.</p><p>Moreover, you might be using YouTube as the platform to showcase your personal brand and develop a reputation that you can bring to the real world.</p><p>Once you have a clear objective for what you want to achieve on YouTube, then you can consider the tactical direction to take your channel in: finding a niche and creating content for it.</p><h4 id="What-is-Your-Passion-3"><a href="#What-is-Your-Passion-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Your Passion?"></a><strong>What is Your Passion?</strong></h4><p>Building a YouTube channel is a grind and if you are not passionate about the topics you are covering in your niche, you may not have the motivation needed to churn out videos day after day, week after week.</p><p>Answering what you are passionate about isn’t enough to form your niche around, but it is definitely a critical part. <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-your-passion.html" >Start by finding your passion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Think of the things that you can do for hours without getting bored. Think of the hobbies you have where you put in hours and hours to improve. Think about all the research you’ve done on a given topic for no other reason than satisfying your own curiosity. These can all help you understand what you are most passionate about.</p><p>Knowing your passion opens an avenue for you to travel down in discovering your niche. But the journey isn’t over yet… there are few more questions to ask:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Expertises-3"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Expertises-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Expertises?"></a><strong>What Are Your Expertises?</strong></h4><p>Over the course of your life, you have gained experiences and skills — and you might not even know it. Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.</p><p>While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?</p><p>If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.</p><h4 id="What-Do-People-Know-You-For-3"><a href="#What-Do-People-Know-You-For-3" class="headerlink" title="What Do People Know You For?"></a><strong>What Do People Know You For?</strong></h4><p>If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?</p><p>If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.</p><p>Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:</p><p>- Can I teach people what I know?</p><p>- Will I want to learn more about this topic?</p><p>- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?</p><p>Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs-3"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?"></a><strong>What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?</strong></h4><p>If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.</p><p>When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:</p><p>- Educate</p><p>- Entertain</p><p>- Inspire</p><h4 id="Educate-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Educate-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Educate Your Audience"></a><strong>Educate Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question. If your content can teach, it will be valuable because it has real-world applications. (example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)</p><h4 id="Entertain-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Entertain-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Entertain Your Audience"></a><strong>Entertain Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)</p><p>Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic. If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.</p><p>Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video.

Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don’t know which camera to use, this article will tell you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best cameras for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.</p><p>Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the ‘Free Option!’ at the bottom of every section!</p><h4 id="1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>1. Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! Any Available Surface:</strong> Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend’s shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.</p><h4 id="2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! The Sun:</strong> Natural light is always powerful enough to make your videos look great. Consider recording outside, or near a window in your house.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Equipment for YouTube"></a>3. Audio Equipment for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Snoball:</strong> A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment05.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> You can get a shotgun mic to attach to your camera at a fairly decent price.

If you still don’t know which camera to use, this article will tell you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best cameras for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.</p><p>Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the ‘Free Option!’ at the bottom of every section!</p><h4 id="1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>1. Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! Any Available Surface:</strong> Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend’s shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.</p><h4 id="2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! The Sun:</strong> Natural light is always powerful enough to make your videos look great. Consider recording outside, or near a window in your house.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Equipment for YouTube"></a>3. Audio Equipment for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Snoball:</strong> A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment05.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> You can get a shotgun mic to attach to your camera at a fairly decent price. The RØDE Video Shotgun Mic is only $140. You will not be able to stray far from your camera as it works best when you are close to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment06.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>MP3 Recorder:</strong> A very high quality voice recorder is one way to record great audio and still be able to move freely. The Roland R-05 WAVE&#x2F;MP3 Recorder is a great choice at $200.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment07.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>LAV System:</strong> A lavalier, or lapel, mic system is a lot of vloggers’ favorite way to record dialogue because the mics are small and clip right on to your clothing. This is a more expensive option. The Sony LAV Wireless Mic System is $600.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>Free Option! Audacity:</strong>  Audacity is free audio recording&#x2F;editing software that is popular with vloggers.

You can download the latest version of Audacity for free from Audacityteam.org</p><h4 id="4-Editing-Your-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Editing-Your-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One-3"><a href="#Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?"></a>Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?</h2><p>YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don’t own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.</p><p>If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.</p><p>Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.</p><p>In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</h2><p>If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.</p><p>First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.</p><p>Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you’ve already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.</p><p>YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.</p><p>The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.</p><p>In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process.

Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords “<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1" >4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select “Stats for nerd”. If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?"></a>Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?</h2><p>Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3. AV2 to come in the future"></a>3. AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

A fresh supply of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas is a necessary ingredient for a successful channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but generating that fresh supply of ideas is easier said than done. When you’re stuck, the best thing to do can be to keep your ideas simple. Focus on being engaging instead of on coming up with an original idea nobody’s ever tried – your video will be original because you’re the one doing it and you’re unique.</p><p>They say that less is more, so let’s have a look at how you can apply this principle to practice and create amazing YouTube videos from small ideas.</p><ol><li><a href="#one">Introduce Yourself</a></li><li><a href="#two">Vlog About Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#three">Express an Opinion</a></li><li><a href="#four">Review Anything</a></li><li><a href="#five">Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc.</a></li><li><a href="#six">What’s on Your Phone?</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Make a Slideshow</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Make a Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#nine">10 Things About You</a></li><li><a href="#ten">Video Rant</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-Introduce-Yourself"><a href="#1-Introduce-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduce Yourself"></a>1. Introduce Yourself</h2><p>Let the world know who you are and what you do. If you are planning on starting a YouTube channel, or if you’ve already been posting videos on a topic but haven’t formally introduced yourself, it’s a great idea to put some thought into an introduction video. Producing such a YouTube video will enable you to introduce yourself to your future subscribers and give them an idea as to what your channel is all about.</p><p>These kinds of videos make great channel trailers, and they’re a good way to highlight the topics you’ll be covering on your channel in the future.</p><h2 id="2-Vlog-About-Your-Day"><a href="#2-Vlog-About-Your-Day" class="headerlink" title="2. Vlog About Your Day"></a>2. Vlog About Your Day</h2><p>Anything that happens during your day can become a topic for your YouTube vlog. Traffic jams, treacherous pets who keep stealing your shoes, or the ridiculous amount of things you had to do in a single day can all become topics for videos you upload to your YouTube channel. Being candid and spontaneous is a sure way to grab the attention of a viewer, but limiting the duration of a vlog to a few minutes is key to ensuring that viewers watch the video until the end.</p><p>Strive to make visually dynamic videos, because just sitting or standing and talking in front of a camera for a few minutes isn’t going to create much on-screen action.</p><h2 id="3-Express-An-Opinion"><a href="#3-Express-An-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="3. Express An Opinion"></a>3. Express An Opinion</h2><p>Social media culture has enabled us to receive news instantly and react to it in any way we want. If you didn’t like the latest update of your favorite video game, or if you’re excited about a line of makeup that’s coming out soon, make a video about it and share your opinion with the community that follows you on YouTube.</p><p>Opinion videos are great conversation starters. Expressing an opinion through a YouTube video can get you a lot of comments and even inspire others to take action.</p><p>You can express your opinions on virtually any topic, but being respectful while doing so is for the best if you don’t want to find yourself in a YouTube feud.</p><h2 id="4-Review-Anything"><a href="#4-Review-Anything" class="headerlink" title="4. Review Anything"></a>4. Review Anything</h2><p>Everywhere around you, there are items you can review. The Apple Watch and the latest season of Game of Thrones are equally good choices for a review video. However, when creating review videos you need to make sure that all the factual information you have is accurate, which is why it is much better to make review videos about topics you know a lot about.</p><p>Review videos can also be a source of revenue because a lot of companies sponsor YouTubers who review their products.</p><h2 id="5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc"><a href="#5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc"></a>5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc</h2><p>Are you a Tarantino fan? Why not? When you are struggling to find inspiration for your videos, just think about the things you like. Your subscribers are interested in you, so they’ll be interested in knowing about your favorite movies or music albums. Books, movies, and music are an inexhaustible source of fresh ideas because there is always a new song or a film you can talk about in your video.</p><p>You can do a ‘my 5 favorite songs’ type of video, or talk in detail about just one favorite.</p><h2 id="6-What’s-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#6-What’s-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="6. What’s on Your Phone?"></a>6. What’s on Your Phone?</h2><p>There were over two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017, and this number is only going to continue rising in the next couple of years. Furthermore, thousands of YouTubers are already producing unimaginable amounts of videos about the latest apps or smartphone devices.</p><p>Finding a way to talk about the apps you like to use the most can be a good idea if you want to attract more visitors to your YouTube channel. However, you need to be clear about whether this is a lifestyle or vlog-style video covering a topic that usually exists in the tech genre, or if you are a tech YouTuber, so as not to confuse your audience (you don’t want people to start expecting app reviews if that’s not what you usually do).</p><h2 id="7-Make-a-Slideshow"><a href="#7-Make-a-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a Slideshow"></a>7. Make a Slideshow</h2><p>There’s no need to constantly produce new videos because you can just take some royalty-free music and create a slideshow from your old or new photos. The slideshow format will certainly allow you to try something different on your YouTube channel, while the photos you use in the slideshow can create a clear picture of who you are and what you do for your viewers.</p><p>If you are a photography enthusiast you can also plan the entire slideshow in advance and then make a short video about how you created the images in the slideshow.</p><h2 id="8-Make-a-Tutorial"><a href="#8-Make-a-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="8. Make a Tutorial"></a>8. Make a Tutorial</h2><p>Education is our only hope for a better world so if you know how to do something well, don’t be afraid to share your knowledge. A tutorial is a powerful educational tool that enables you to guide people through the entire process of making origami, solving a complicated video editing problem, maintaining a motorcycle, or anything else.</p><p>YouTube channels that feature tutorials often have millions of followers, because YouTube is a popular place to go when you need information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-10-Things-About-You"><a href="#9-10-Things-About-You" class="headerlink" title="9. 10 Things About You"></a>9. 10 Things About You</h2><p>Being open is important, so why not share 10 things about yourself you think your audience would find interesting or which you think are important for people to know. The top 10 things structure is often used in YouTube videos because it provides a clear rhythm to a video clip, and it enables you to gradually increase the tension as the video progresses.</p><p>These types of videos tend to create a better relationship with your audience because they make the viewer feel as if they know the person on the screen.</p><h2 id="10-Video-Rant"><a href="#10-Video-Rant" class="headerlink" title="10. Video Rant"></a>10. Video Rant</h2><p>Doing things when you are angry is usually a bad idea, but if you feel so strongly about a particular subject then creating a video rant can be a great idea. Rants don’t even have to be angry, they can be about something that puzzles you or something so great you just can’t get over it. These kinds of videos can get your YouTube channel a lot of comments, likes, and subscribers.</p><p>Don’t try to fake a rant, because they only work if they are natural.

Being candid and spontaneous is a sure way to grab the attention of a viewer, but limiting the duration of a vlog to a few minutes is key to ensuring that viewers watch the video until the end.</p><p>Strive to make visually dynamic videos, because just sitting or standing and talking in front of a camera for a few minutes isn’t going to create much on-screen action.</p><h2 id="3-Express-An-Opinion-3"><a href="#3-Express-An-Opinion-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Express An Opinion"></a>3. Express An Opinion</h2><p>Social media culture has enabled us to receive news instantly and react to it in any way we want. If you didn’t like the latest update of your favorite video game, or if you’re excited about a line of makeup that’s coming out soon, make a video about it and share your opinion with the community that follows you on YouTube.</p><p>Opinion videos are great conversation starters. Expressing an opinion through a YouTube video can get you a lot of comments and even inspire others to take action.</p><p>You can express your opinions on virtually any topic, but being respectful while doing so is for the best if you don’t want to find yourself in a YouTube feud.</p><h2 id="4-Review-Anything-3"><a href="#4-Review-Anything-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Review Anything"></a>4. Review Anything</h2><p>Everywhere around you, there are items you can review. The Apple Watch and the latest season of Game of Thrones are equally good choices for a review video. However, when creating review videos you need to make sure that all the factual information you have is accurate, which is why it is much better to make review videos about topics you know a lot about.</p><p>Review videos can also be a source of revenue because a lot of companies sponsor YouTubers who review their products.</p><h2 id="5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc-3"><a href="#5-Your-Favorite-Songs-Movies-Etc-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc"></a>5. Your Favorite Songs &#x2F; Movies &#x2F; Etc</h2><p>Are you a Tarantino fan? Why not? When you are struggling to find inspiration for your videos, just think about the things you like. Your subscribers are interested in you, so they’ll be interested in knowing about your favorite movies or music albums. Books, movies, and music are an inexhaustible source of fresh ideas because there is always a new song or a film you can talk about in your video.</p><p>You can do a ‘my 5 favorite songs’ type of video, or talk in detail about just one favorite.</p><h2 id="6-What’s-on-Your-Phone-3"><a href="#6-What’s-on-Your-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="6. What’s on Your Phone?"></a>6. What’s on Your Phone?</h2><p>There were over two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017, and this number is only going to continue rising in the next couple of years. Furthermore, thousands of YouTubers are already producing unimaginable amounts of videos about the latest apps or smartphone devices.</p><p>Finding a way to talk about the apps you like to use the most can be a good idea if you want to attract more visitors to your YouTube channel. However, you need to be clear about whether this is a lifestyle or vlog-style video covering a topic that usually exists in the tech genre, or if you are a tech YouTuber, so as not to confuse your audience (you don’t want people to start expecting app reviews if that’s not what you usually do).</p><h2 id="7-Make-a-Slideshow-3"><a href="#7-Make-a-Slideshow-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a Slideshow"></a>7. Make a Slideshow</h2><p>There’s no need to constantly produce new videos because you can just take some royalty-free music and create a slideshow from your old or new photos. The slideshow format will certainly allow you to try something different on your YouTube channel, while the photos you use in the slideshow can create a clear picture of who you are and what you do for your viewers.</p><p>If you are a photography enthusiast you can also plan the entire slideshow in advance and then make a short video about how you created the images in the slideshow.</p><h2 id="8-Make-a-Tutorial-3"><a href="#8-Make-a-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Make a Tutorial"></a>8. Make a Tutorial</h2><p>Education is our only hope for a better world so if you know how to do something well, don’t be afraid to share your knowledge. A tutorial is a powerful educational tool that enables you to guide people through the entire process of making origami, solving a complicated video editing problem, maintaining a motorcycle, or anything else.</p><p>YouTube channels that feature tutorials often have millions of followers, because YouTube is a popular place to go when you need information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="9-10-Things-About-You-3"><a href="#9-10-Things-About-You-3" class="headerlink" title="9. 10 Things About You"></a>9. 10 Things About You</h2><p>Being open is important, so why not share 10 things about yourself you think your audience would find interesting or which you think are important for people to know. The top 10 things structure is often used in YouTube videos because it provides a clear rhythm to a video clip, and it enables you to gradually increase the tension as the video progresses.</p><p>These types of videos tend to create a better relationship with your audience because they make the viewer feel as if they know the person on the screen.</p><h2 id="10-Video-Rant-3"><a href="#10-Video-Rant-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Video Rant"></a>10. Video Rant</h2><p>Doing things when you are angry is usually a bad idea, but if you feel so strongly about a particular subject then creating a video rant can be a great idea. Rants don’t even have to be angry, they can be about something that puzzles you or something so great you just can’t get over it. These kinds of videos can get your YouTube channel a lot of comments, likes, and subscribers.</p><p>Don’t try to fake a rant, because they only work if they are natural. Scripting a video rant may be an interesting creative task, but genuine reactions are always more effective. If you want to deliver a more structured and planned video about a topic you feel strongly about, that’d be more like an opinion video.</p><p>Do you have any <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >easy video ideas for other creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to try?</p><h2 id="Start-Editing-Videos-with-Beginner-friendly-Software-3"><a href="#Start-Editing-Videos-with-Beginner-friendly-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="Start Editing Videos with Beginner-friendly Software"></a>Start Editing Videos with Beginner-friendly Software</h2><p>If you start your YouTube channel but have no video editing experience, Wondershare Filmora will definitely help you get over the problems.
