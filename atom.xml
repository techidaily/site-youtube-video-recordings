Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership-3"><a href="#2-Membership-3" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business. The higher the cost, the greater level of support and storage capacity you will get. There is a free membership available but you will only be able to use up to 500MB each week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-membership.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-membership"                ></p><h4 id="3-Advertising-3"><a href="#3-Advertising-3" class="headerlink" title="3  Advertising"></a>3  Advertising</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> What makes YouTube free is the fact they get their money from the advertisements they put not only on their sites but before video’s that people have to watch a set amount of seconds for before they can view their video of choice. This is great news if you are a marketer as it will allow you to reach out to viewers on video’s that are relevant to your brand&#x2F;product&#x2F;service, however for those that are viewing the sheer amount of ads can be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advertising.jpg"                      alt="youtube-advertising"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> As a paid subscription service and even the limited free package, you won’t have to view or show viewers ads, which means that your videos are more likely to be seen in their entirety not abandoned due to advertisements.</p><h4 id="4-Updating-video-3"><a href="#4-Updating-video-3" class="headerlink" title="4  Updating video"></a>4  Updating video</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> If you upload videos to YouTube you do not have the same benefits as the only way to amend a video is to take it down, delete it and re-upload a new one. This unfortunately takes with it any statistics such as views that you have gained. If you do choose YouTube for your videos then do make sure you check everything vigorously before you upload it as there’s no way to change it.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> Occasionally an uploaded video may need some changes made. This could be due to changes to the offer you have or you have noticed something else that needs amending. With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract. With Vimeo you are more likely to attract creators and film makers, whereas with YouTube you will have a bigger audience to target which gives you a better chance of a higher rank on search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Enhancing-Your-YouTube-Content-Basic-Premiere-Pro-Edits"><a href="#Enhancing-Your-YouTube-Content-Basic-Premiere-Pro-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing Your YouTube Content: Basic Premiere Pro Edits"></a>Enhancing Your YouTube Content: Basic Premiere Pro Edits</h2><h1 id="How-to-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#How-to-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit YouTube Videos in Adobe Premiere"></a>How to Edit YouTube Videos in Adobe Premiere</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> You just made a few videos, and you want to edit them first before uploading to YouTube.

This is achieved using a simple process of clicking “import” from the “file” drop-down menu. Once you have finished importing your photos or video files, you can then drag them from the sidebar and into the editing area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-interface.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Note-3"><a href="#Note-3" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h5><ul><li>If the videos you want to import are already published online, you can start the process by first downloading them directly from YouTube first, making sure to save them as MP4 files.</li><li>The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-2-Editing-3"><a href="#Step-2-Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Editing"></a>Step 2: Editing</h4><p> The next step in how edit YouTube videos with Adobe Premiere is to start modifying the video files or photos the way you want. To achieve this, click on “Effects Control” and apply the desired effects. If you want to insert some text or words into your video, select “title” and then click “new title.” Now choose how you would like the words to behave, for instance, “Default Roll” makes the text roll upwards in the page.</p><p> Now drag the text that you have created into the editor area. If you want to edit the text, simply double-click to select it, and it will bring up a separate page where you can make further edits. You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-with-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p> The final part of the process is to import your chosen audio file.

Activating YouTube is pretty straightforward if you already have a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube with your Google account</p><p>Step 2: Access YouTube Creator Studio to Activate YouTube</p><p>Step 3: Create a Channel</p><h3 id="1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name"><a href="#1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name</h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description" class="headerlink" title="2.

This tool shows you the search volume (how frequently it is searched for) as well as how competitive (how many other channels are using it) the keyword is.</p><p>Heighten your chance of discoverability by putting keywords as close to the beginning of the description as possible. Later on in this post, we will go through how to properly conduct a keyword strategy. Hang tight.</p><p>In addition to keywords, you should also introduce who you are and what the channel is about. Give them a reason to care about your channel, how is it different than all the other ones on YouTube? Why are you the best person to be producing the content on your channel?</p><p>Then encourage the viewers to subscribe if they are interested in what the channel offers: education, entertainment, adventure, or something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your channel, sell it.</p><p>Finally supply some extra details, including when to expect videos to be published and other social platforms where you are active on.

Before you select a color scheme, know how you want your audience to feel.</p><h4 id="3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have"><a href="#3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have" class="headerlink" title="#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?"></a>#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural? You might not want to put an icon of a robot next to a font that looks like calligraphy.</p><h4 id="4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo"><a href="#4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo" class="headerlink" title="#4.

What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research. This research will help dictate the tags, titles, and descriptions of your videos once they are ready to publish.</p><p>There are a few ways to conduct keyword research, but we suggest using free online tools to help cut down the time spent.</p><h3 id="1-Free-tools"><a href="#1-Free-tools" class="headerlink" title="1.

Without a proper routine and schedule, YouTubers will end up procrastinating and publishing whenever they finish their content.</p><p>In order to properly establish an audience for your channel, there needs to be consistency and that is why it is so important to have a content calendar to affirm when a piece of content is due to be published, thus giving the creator a good idea of when to start each step of the process to meet publishing date.</p><p>There are many ways to build out a content calendar, you can simply use a spreadsheet, a calendar, or you can use other management&#x2F;organization tools such as <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://asana.com/" >Asana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We recommend using Google Sheet and Google Calendar to start, as it is free and easy to use.</p><p>Since you are starting out, we suggest that you plan on a monthly basis, as it’ll allow you to be flexible to trending topics and adjust to insights that you’ll acquire as you analyze your content’s performance.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Producing-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Producing-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Producing Your Content"></a>Part 3: Producing Your Content</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/produce-youtube-video-content-filming.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Filming"                ></p><p>Now that you have a plan it is time to start producing your content. There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out. Nevertheless, YouTube recommends using MP4 and encoded with the  codec.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video</h2><p>Your job is not done after you’ve filmed, edited, and published your video on YouTube.

Activating YouTube is pretty straightforward if you already have a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube with your Google account</p><p>Step 2: Access YouTube Creator Studio to Activate YouTube</p><p>Step 3: Create a Channel</p><h3 id="1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-1"><a href="#1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name</h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-1"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural?

What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-1"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research. This research will help dictate the tags, titles, and descriptions of your videos once they are ready to publish.</p><p>There are a few ways to conduct keyword research, but we suggest using free online tools to help cut down the time spent.</p><h3 id="1-Free-tools-1"><a href="#1-Free-tools-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Without a proper routine and schedule, YouTubers will end up procrastinating and publishing whenever they finish their content.</p><p>In order to properly establish an audience for your channel, there needs to be consistency and that is why it is so important to have a content calendar to affirm when a piece of content is due to be published, thus giving the creator a good idea of when to start each step of the process to meet publishing date.</p><p>There are many ways to build out a content calendar, you can simply use a spreadsheet, a calendar, or you can use other management&#x2F;organization tools such as <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://asana.com/" >Asana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out. Nevertheless, YouTube recommends using MP4 and encoded with the  codec.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video</h2><p>Your job is not done after you’ve filmed, edited, and published your video on YouTube.

How to Share Your Video with Social Media</h4><p>Unless you have a huge social media following, it will be challenging to get many views from those channels at the start.</p><p>Grow your social media channel gradually by targeting your ideal viewer persona and hashtagging your content. On social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter, keep producing content for them, but don’t forget to share content from other YouTubers. If you see a cool video relevant to your audience, share it as well.</p><p>Lead your followers to your YouTube channel with content designed specifically for your social media channel. For example, Instagram Stories are a great way to engage directly with your followers, giving them a sneak peek or letting them know that your latest YouTube videos are up. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.plannthat.com/instagram-story-links/" >link directly to your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-caspar-lee.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Story Caspar Lee"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Caspar Lee</em></p><p>Join groups on social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, etc. and engage in conversations that are related or complementary to your YouTube channel.

Activating YouTube is pretty straightforward if you already have a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube with your Google account</p><p>Step 2: Access YouTube Creator Studio to Activate YouTube</p><p>Step 3: Create a Channel</p><h3 id="1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-2"><a href="#1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name</h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-2"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description"></a>2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description</h3><p>YouTube is a search engine and the channel description can be treated much like an About page for a website. That is why keywords are important when composing the channel description.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What are YouTube SEO keywords? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Keywords are the words and phrases people use when they are typing into the search engine to find content. Without the right keywords, your audience may never find your videos.</p><p>If you want to start discovering new keywords for your YouTube channel, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This tool shows you the search volume (how frequently it is searched for) as well as how competitive (how many other channels are using it) the keyword is.</p><p>Heighten your chance of discoverability by putting keywords as close to the beginning of the description as possible. Later on in this post, we will go through how to properly conduct a keyword strategy. Hang tight.</p><p>In addition to keywords, you should also introduce who you are and what the channel is about. Give them a reason to care about your channel, how is it different than all the other ones on YouTube? Why are you the best person to be producing the content on your channel?</p><p>Then encourage the viewers to subscribe if they are interested in what the channel offers: education, entertainment, adventure, or something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your channel, sell it.</p><p>Finally supply some extra details, including when to expect videos to be published and other social platforms where you are active on.

What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?"></a>#1. What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?</h4><p>You may choose an icon that best represents the content your channel is producing. For example, if your channel is about technology, you can have an icon of a robot or an iPhone. This way, when viewers only see your icon, they have an idea that they can expect content around tech.</p><p>Here are some websites in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download logos and icons for YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be-2"><a href="#2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be-2" class="headerlink" title="#2.

Instead, consider <a class="link"   href="https://99designs.ca/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/" >the psychology of color <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What emotions do you want your channel to evoke to your viewers?</p><p>Answering this question helps you develop a consistent branding that applies to all your content as your channel grows. Blue evokes calm and trust, whereas, red is known to increase heart rate and is associated with danger. Before you select a color scheme, know how you want your audience to feel.</p><h4 id="3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have-2"><a href="#3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have-2" class="headerlink" title="#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?"></a>#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural? You might not want to put an icon of a robot next to a font that looks like calligraphy.</p><h4 id="4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo-2"><a href="#4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo-2" class="headerlink" title="#4.

I ask because the more you have on your logo, the less space it will have to stand out.</p><p>White space is your friend, it keeps the viewer’s attention focused on what matters and keeps the design uncluttered.</p><p>Save your logo as a vector so that you have the ability to scale without losing the image’s quality.</p><p>I get it, you are here to make a YouTube channel, not to design a logo.

What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-2"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research. This research will help dictate the tags, titles, and descriptions of your videos once they are ready to publish.</p><p>There are a few ways to conduct keyword research, but we suggest using free online tools to help cut down the time spent.</p><h3 id="1-Free-tools-2"><a href="#1-Free-tools-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Without a proper routine and schedule, YouTubers will end up procrastinating and publishing whenever they finish their content.</p><p>In order to properly establish an audience for your channel, there needs to be consistency and that is why it is so important to have a content calendar to affirm when a piece of content is due to be published, thus giving the creator a good idea of when to start each step of the process to meet publishing date.</p><p>There are many ways to build out a content calendar, you can simply use a spreadsheet, a calendar, or you can use other management&#x2F;organization tools such as <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://asana.com/" >Asana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out. Nevertheless, YouTube recommends using MP4 and encoded with the  codec.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-2"><a href="#Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video</h2><p>Your job is not done after you’ve filmed, edited, and published your video on YouTube.

For example, Instagram Stories are a great way to engage directly with your followers, giving them a sneak peek or letting them know that your latest YouTube videos are up.

Activating YouTube is pretty straightforward if you already have a Google account. The odds are you have already set one up to subscribe to all your favorite channels. If not, here are the steps:</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube with your Google account</p><p>Step 2: Access YouTube Creator Studio to Activate YouTube</p><p>Step 3: Create a Channel</p><h3 id="1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-3"><a href="#1-Picking-a-YouTube-Channel-Name-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. Picking a YouTube Channel Name</h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-3"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description"></a>2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description</h3><p>YouTube is a search engine and the channel description can be treated much like an About page for a website. That is why keywords are important when composing the channel description.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What are YouTube SEO keywords? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Keywords are the words and phrases people use when they are typing into the search engine to find content. Without the right keywords, your audience may never find your videos.</p><p>If you want to start discovering new keywords for your YouTube channel, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This tool shows you the search volume (how frequently it is searched for) as well as how competitive (how many other channels are using it) the keyword is.</p><p>Heighten your chance of discoverability by putting keywords as close to the beginning of the description as possible. Later on in this post, we will go through how to properly conduct a keyword strategy. Hang tight.</p><p>In addition to keywords, you should also introduce who you are and what the channel is about. Give them a reason to care about your channel, how is it different than all the other ones on YouTube? Why are you the best person to be producing the content on your channel?</p><p>Then encourage the viewers to subscribe if they are interested in what the channel offers: education, entertainment, adventure, or something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your channel, sell it.</p><p>Finally supply some extra details, including when to expect videos to be published and other social platforms where you are active on.

What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?"></a>#1. What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?</h4><p>You may choose an icon that best represents the content your channel is producing. For example, if your channel is about technology, you can have an icon of a robot or an iPhone. This way, when viewers only see your icon, they have an idea that they can expect content around tech.</p><p>Here are some websites in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download logos and icons for YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be-3"><a href="#2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="#2.

Blue evokes calm and trust, whereas, red is known to increase heart rate and is associated with danger. Before you select a color scheme, know how you want your audience to feel.</p><h4 id="3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have-3"><a href="#3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?"></a>#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural? You might not want to put an icon of a robot next to a font that looks like calligraphy.</p><h4 id="4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo-3"><a href="#4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="#4.

I ask because the more you have on your logo, the less space it will have to stand out.</p><p>White space is your friend, it keeps the viewer’s attention focused on what matters and keeps the design uncluttered.</p><p>Save your logo as a vector so that you have the ability to scale without losing the image’s quality.</p><p>I get it, you are here to make a YouTube channel, not to design a logo.

What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-3"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research.

Set Up a Content Calendar to Be Consistent on YouTube"></a>3. Set Up a Content Calendar to Be Consistent on YouTube</h3><p>A common issue for many YouTubers is consistency and accountability. Without a proper routine and schedule, YouTubers will end up procrastinating and publishing whenever they finish their content.</p><p>In order to properly establish an audience for your channel, there needs to be consistency and that is why it is so important to have a content calendar to affirm when a piece of content is due to be published, thus giving the creator a good idea of when to start each step of the process to meet publishing date.</p><p>There are many ways to build out a content calendar, you can simply use a spreadsheet, a calendar, or you can use other management&#x2F;organization tools such as <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://asana.com/" >Asana <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. We recommend using Google Sheet and Google Calendar to start, as it is free and easy to use.</p><p>Since you are starting out, we suggest that you plan on a monthly basis, as it’ll allow you to be flexible to trending topics and adjust to insights that you’ll acquire as you analyze your content’s performance.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Producing-Your-Content-3"><a href="#Part-3-Producing-Your-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Producing Your Content"></a>Part 3: Producing Your Content</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/produce-youtube-video-content-filming.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Filming"                ></p><p>Now that you have a plan it is time to start producing your content. There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out. Nevertheless, YouTube recommends using MP4 and encoded with the  codec.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video</h2><p>Your job is not done after you’ve filmed, edited, and published your video on YouTube. In order to help it get discovered, you’ll need to understand what will drive your audience to click and watch your video as opposed to all the other videos on YouTube.</p><p>By performing video optimization and sharing your content in communities interested in what you are creating, you can increase the chances that your video will be seen.</p><h4 id="1-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Title-for-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#1-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Title-for-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Tips for Writing the Best Title for YouTube Video"></a>1. Tips for Writing the Best Title for YouTube Video</h4><p>When coming up with titles for your YouTube video, you should always have your keyword research-ready on hand for reference.</p><p>YouTube keyword crawlers read from top to bottom, so it is most effective to have your keywords at the beginning of the title. Strive to build click-worthy titles that inspire curiosity, evoke an emotion, or offer a benefit.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Good: How to Deep Fry Chicken</p><p>Better: Deep Frying Chicken That’s Better Than KFC</p><p>While you have 100 characters to work with, anything beyond 70 characters will be truncated by YouTube.</p><p>Caution: Always deliver what your title is selling. Misleading viewers can cause mistrust in your content and will turn people off your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Description-for-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Description-for-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Tips for Writing the Best Description for YouTube Video</h4><p>Treat the description as a short synopsis for your video with the keywords strategically placed at the beginning. Include a URL to your website or blog and have any other supporting information or links.</p><p>Also, the description is where you can include some boilerplate channel information.</p><p>You have 5,000 characters to work with, but only the first three lines will be above the fold.</p><p>Pro Tip: If your video is on the longer end (over 20 minutes) or has multiple sections, then you should consider <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBiPumGnVT4" >adding timestamps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the description to help the viewer skip to the spot they are most interested in.</p><h4 id="3-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Tags-for-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Tags-for-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image"></a>4. Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image</h4><p><strong>Customize thumbnails</strong>: It is recommended that you take some time to customize a thumbnail image for your video. This is the first impression and you want to entice the viewer to click and watch.</p><p>YouTube auto-selects your thumbnail from a random position on your timeline, so it isn’t mandatory to create a thumbnail, however, the image YouTube selects might not be what you want to use to attract your audience.</p><p><strong>Use photo editing software</strong>: To control how you want an image to look, you will need to choose a photo editing software. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good choice that provides various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg"                      alt="pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker"                ></p><p><strong>Have a consistent look</strong>: By having consistency, people will begin to recognize your thumbnails and even getting them excited to watch your video.</p><p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong></p><p>- Avoid using YouTube’s randomly selected thumbnail. Personalize it to stay consistent with your brand.</p><p>- Don’t clutter thumbnails. Less is more.</p><p>- Make fonts big if you are going to use text.</p><p>- Thumbnails have to have context, what is their story? Deliver on that promise.</p><p>- Using emotive faces have shown to appeal to people’s emotional cues and increases the likelihood of them clicking.</p><p>- Thumbnail file size should be 1280 x 720</p><h4 id="5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript-3"><a href="#5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Closed Captions and Uploading a Transcript</h4><p>There are two key reasons why it is worth your time to use closed captions or upload a transcript for your YouTube videos.</p><ol><li>Having closed captions improves the video’s SEO, as Google indexes and crawls the keywords.</li><li>For those that don’t want to or can’t hear the audio will appreciate having closed caption to allow them to enjoy the content.</li></ol><h4 id="6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media-3"><a href="#6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media"></a>6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media</h4><p>Unless you have a huge social media following, it will be challenging to get many views from those channels at the start.</p><p>Grow your social media channel gradually by targeting your ideal viewer persona and hashtagging your content. On social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter, keep producing content for them, but don’t forget to share content from other YouTubers. If you see a cool video relevant to your audience, share it as well.</p><p>Lead your followers to your YouTube channel with content designed specifically for your social media channel. For example, Instagram Stories are a great way to engage directly with your followers, giving them a sneak peek or letting them know that your latest YouTube videos are up. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.plannthat.com/instagram-story-links/" >link directly to your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-caspar-lee.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Story Caspar Lee"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Caspar Lee</em></p><p>Join groups on social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, etc. and engage in conversations that are related or complementary to your YouTube channel. The key is to find communities that are interested in the content you are producing, but approach those groups with caution and ensure that anything you share won’t be perceived as spam.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There you go, now you have made your first YouTube video. It might be something you are incredibly proud of or it might have been a great learning experience. It might have gone without a hitch or you might have encountered obstacles you weren’t anticipating. Either way, you followed through and we are happy for you.</p><p>Now, get ready for the next one. The job of a YouTuber is never complete as there is always another video to make. By executing what we taught you in this guide, you now have the foundation to grow your channel.

If none of the previous methods work, try <strong>YouTube Vanced</strong>, the advanced and premium version of YouTube to get rid of YouTube Shorts. Well, not only that, but YouTube Vanced also comes up with multiple services that you can enjoy along with it, such as disabling YouTube Shorts, blocking ads, stories, or any of the sponsored features.</p><p>If not sure how to go about it, then let’s have a look over the following steps that will guide you to get YouTube Vanced.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download YouTube Vanced</strong></p><p>First, download the YouTube Vanced application from its website.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Install and complete the setup process</strong></p><p>After that, complete the installation process and follow the on-screen direction rightly to make it work effectively for you.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are downloading from the website, not from the app store, then there might appear the warning.

For most, it’s a way to scratch a creative itch, to enjoy being in front of an audience and as an outlet for their talents and opinions. However, the potential to make money on YouTube is huge, and eventually any busy channel is going to start asking itself, how do YouTubers make money?</p><p>This subject is less about ‘if’ you can make money and more about how to make money on YouTube. It’s been proven time and again that the potential is there, with popular stars like Lily Singh and Roman Atwood generating around $8 million a year. And, of course, everyone’s heard of PewDiePie and his whopping $15 million income.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-earning-youtubers.jpg"                      alt="youtubers"                ></p><p>You don’t need to have a following of millions to earn money on YouTube though; even small channels have a variety of methods available to them to start making their hard work pay. If you’d like to learn how to make money on YouTube, we’re going to look at eight ways of generating an income via your videos. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1. Go to your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and, under <strong>Channel</strong>, select <strong>Status and features</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-creatorstudio.JPG"                      alt="monetize creatorstudio"                ></p><p>2. Click on <strong>Enable</strong> next to <strong>Monetization</strong>.</p><p>3. In the next screen, click the blue <strong>Enable my Account</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-enablescreen.JPG"                      alt="monetize enablescreen"                ></p><p>4. <strong>The YouTube Partner Program Terms</strong> will pop up. Compared to a lot of the “Terms” you are asked to read and agree to when signing up for things online the Partner Terms are fairly short and readable.</p><p>5. After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6. After you have checked all the boxes and moved on you will see a pop up explaining how to monetize your individual videos.</p><p>Your channel is now monetized, but you will not be able to earn money until you have linked your channel to your AdSense account.</p><p>7. There will be a reminder to link your channel and your AdSense account in the next screen. Click on the <strong>Link my account</strong> button. Or, go to Google.com&#x2F;adsense and click <strong>Sign Up Now</strong>. Either method will take you to the Welcome to AdSense page.</p><p>8. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> to sign in to your Google account, which is the same as your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-adsense.JPG"                      alt="monetize adsense"                ></p><p>9. After you have signed in it will show you your channel url next to <strong>My website</strong> and give you a chance to change your language. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>10. The last step is to fill out all your contact information before you submit your application. Your approval should come within two days.</p><p>11. Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> and check the boxes next to all the videos you want to enable ads for.</p><p>12. Click on <strong>Actions</strong> and then select <strong>Monetize</strong>.</p><p>13. In the window that pops up you will be given a chance to choose what kinds of ads you want to allow in your videos. You must also specify here if you have included paid product placement in your video.</p><p>14. Wait for the review process to finish and ads to start appearing in your videos. If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads? Check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Money Calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="How-to-optimize-your-video-to-attract-advertisers"><a href="#How-to-optimize-your-video-to-attract-advertisers" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize your video to attract advertisers"></a>How to optimize your video to attract advertisers</h4><p>There is, understandably, a good deal of competition for hosting advertisements on YouTube. In order to get more and better brands advertising in your space, you’ll need to make sure you’ve done all that you can to make your channel attractive to them.</p><ol><li><strong>Target a specific demographic</strong></li></ol><p>Your advertisers want to place their products in front of a very specific audience, so the more embedded in your niche your videos are, the more likely you are to attract investment. If you try to be all things to all people, advertisers are going to see that you’re a risky prospect and will move on to a channel that’s more targeted.</p><p>To check demographics, YouTube has everything already there for you. In the YouTube Studio, you’ll find the exact demographics of your audience profile, including age, country of origin and gender. You can see how appealing your videos are to the people you are targeting by checking the spread of representation here.</p><ol><li><strong>Pay attention to your video metadata</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube metadata is an often-overlooked element of content that is actually incredibly important, both for advertising revenue and for views in general. What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket. Add to this the huge viewership you’re going to need in order to make serious money, it’s worth investigating other methods of making money on YouTube. Here are some of the best ideas.</p><ol><li><strong>Work with brands</strong></li></ol><p>Influencer marketing is big business right now, and brands all over the world are investing in individuals who have secured the loyalty and trust of their target demographic. Sponsored videos might feature product placement, promoting a product from your sponsor, or you may be asked to produce a particular piece of content to support their campaign. Check out influencer marketplaces like Famebit, Grapevine Logic and Crowdtap to see what’s available to you. If you want to make work with brands, you can check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful influencer marketing platform, which will help you to build good relationship with brands.</p><ol><li><strong>Selling products or merchandise</strong></li></ol><p>Selling ‘merch’ is a great way to discover how to earn money from YouTube. T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, hats…whatever fits with you and your brand can become an amazing source of revenue for your business. Not only does this increase your exposure as a brand by putting it out there into the non-YouTube world, it also gives your fans a way to literally buy into what you’re doing.</p><ol><li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong></li></ol><p>Affiliate marketing doesn’t have to be hard work or complicated. Registering with big sales platforms such as Amazon is often as simple as filling out a couple of forms. Once registered, you can use your own special links to hook your viewers up with a product that you would recommend, and you’ll get a proportion of the final sale value. It’s not only Amazon who offer affiliate programs; most major brands will offer some kind of sales commission, so if you’re in a niche that calls for specialist products to promote, do contact brands directly to find out what they can offer.</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong></li></ol><p>If you’ve got an amazingly creative idea but lack of funds is stopping you from putting it into action, crowdfunding could be the way to go. Crowdfunded projects can use the money they make to buy better production equipment, hire people to work on the project, pay for props, anything really. A good way to get started with crowdfunding a particular idea is to create a ‘trailer’ or sneak peek that gives people a better idea of what you want to do. Make sure it gets them so excited that they can’t help but donate to your cause!</p><ol><li><strong>Renting out your video</strong></li></ol><p>You have the ability to rent out individual videos for cold, hard cash, just like a pay per view service. The options for this are in the Creator Studio, where you can set the amount you want to rent it out for as well as creating an enticing trailer to encourage people to buy. Choose to either sell your video permanently, letting the person view it whenever they like, or rent for a limited time, usually 24 to 72 hours.</p><ol><li><strong>License your content to the media</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re lucky enough to make a video that goes viral, you can make serious bucks by licensing it to the wider media. From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers. You can also proactively offer your content for sale via sites like Juken Media, where others can find it and purchase it directly.</p><p>Now you know how to earn money from YouTube, what are you going to try?

Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube-1"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads-1"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not-1"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform-1"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1.

After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6.

If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads-1"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads?

In order to get more and better brands advertising in your space, you’ll need to make sure you’ve done all that you can to make your channel attractive to them.</p><ol><li><strong>Target a specific demographic</strong></li></ol><p>Your advertisers want to place their products in front of a very specific audience, so the more embedded in your niche your videos are, the more likely you are to attract investment. If you try to be all things to all people, advertisers are going to see that you’re a risky prospect and will move on to a channel that’s more targeted.</p><p>To check demographics, YouTube has everything already there for you. In the YouTube Studio, you’ll find the exact demographics of your audience profile, including age, country of origin and gender. You can see how appealing your videos are to the people you are targeting by checking the spread of representation here.</p><ol><li><strong>Pay attention to your video metadata</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube metadata is an often-overlooked element of content that is actually incredibly important, both for advertising revenue and for views in general. What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads-1"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket. Add to this the huge viewership you’re going to need in order to make serious money, it’s worth investigating other methods of making money on YouTube. Here are some of the best ideas.</p><ol><li><strong>Work with brands</strong></li></ol><p>Influencer marketing is big business right now, and brands all over the world are investing in individuals who have secured the loyalty and trust of their target demographic. Sponsored videos might feature product placement, promoting a product from your sponsor, or you may be asked to produce a particular piece of content to support their campaign. Check out influencer marketplaces like Famebit, Grapevine Logic and Crowdtap to see what’s available to you. If you want to make work with brands, you can check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful influencer marketing platform, which will help you to build good relationship with brands.</p><ol><li><strong>Selling products or merchandise</strong></li></ol><p>Selling ‘merch’ is a great way to discover how to earn money from YouTube. T-shirts, tote bags, mugs, hats…whatever fits with you and your brand can become an amazing source of revenue for your business. Not only does this increase your exposure as a brand by putting it out there into the non-YouTube world, it also gives your fans a way to literally buy into what you’re doing.</p><ol><li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong></li></ol><p>Affiliate marketing doesn’t have to be hard work or complicated. Registering with big sales platforms such as Amazon is often as simple as filling out a couple of forms. Once registered, you can use your own special links to hook your viewers up with a product that you would recommend, and you’ll get a proportion of the final sale value. It’s not only Amazon who offer affiliate programs; most major brands will offer some kind of sales commission, so if you’re in a niche that calls for specialist products to promote, do contact brands directly to find out what they can offer.</p><ol><li><strong>Crowdfund</strong></li></ol><p>If you’ve got an amazingly creative idea but lack of funds is stopping you from putting it into action, crowdfunding could be the way to go. Crowdfunded projects can use the money they make to buy better production equipment, hire people to work on the project, pay for props, anything really. A good way to get started with crowdfunding a particular idea is to create a ‘trailer’ or sneak peek that gives people a better idea of what you want to do. Make sure it gets them so excited that they can’t help but donate to your cause!</p><ol><li><strong>Renting out your video</strong></li></ol><p>You have the ability to rent out individual videos for cold, hard cash, just like a pay per view service. The options for this are in the Creator Studio, where you can set the amount you want to rent it out for as well as creating an enticing trailer to encourage people to buy. Choose to either sell your video permanently, letting the person view it whenever they like, or rent for a limited time, usually 24 to 72 hours.</p><ol><li><strong>License your content to the media</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re lucky enough to make a video that goes viral, you can make serious bucks by licensing it to the wider media. From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers. You can also proactively offer your content for sale via sites like Juken Media, where others can find it and purchase it directly.</p><p>Now you know how to earn money from YouTube, what are you going to try?

What we mean when we talk about metadata is your tags, title and description of your video, all of which should make use of high traffic keywords that you’ve researched as being relevant.</p><p>YouTube’s own keyword suggestion tool can be a great place to start finding those golden keywords that will get you noticed. Advertisers often use your metadata to locate videos that their customers are watching, so SEO is crucial here. Not only that, but when viewers are looking for new videos to watch, the SEO of your metadata will define where in the search results you fall, so putting some time and energy into this can get you more views too.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid dodgy video content</strong></li></ol><p>There are some types of content which are just not a good idea for YouTube. In fact, the platform could exclude you from advertising altogether if your content is found to contain any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexually suggestive content</strong>: This includes making jokes based around sexual topics, as well as partial nudity of anyone in the video.</li><li><strong>Violence</strong>: This ranges from topics of extremism to videos of people sustaining serious injuries, as well as threats and suggestions of violence.</li><li><strong>Inappropriate language</strong>: Even the most popular YouTubers have started bleeping out their profanities, so avoid vulgar language or anything that could be construed as being threatening.</li><li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Promotion of the use, sale or abuse of drugs and other controlled substances is forbidden.</li><li><strong>Sensitive</strong> <strong>subjects</strong>: This includes references to wars, race crimes, natural disasters, political conflicts, even if you don’t show images of the situation itself.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flagged-content-on-youtube.jpg"                      alt="flagged content"                ></p><p>When you’re considering how do YouTubers make money, you should recognize that those who make the most money avoid creating content that breaches any of these rules. YouTube does notify you if it feels your video is in breach of ‘advertiser friendly’ policies, and you’ll have the chance to contest the ban, but if you steer clear of dodgy content in the first place you shouldn’t run into any issues.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads-2"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-without-ads-2" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube without ads"></a>Make money on YouTube without ads</h3><p>Of course, life is not all about ads, and with YouTube continuing to tighten its criteria around advertising it can be a good idea not to have all your eggs in one basket.

From online news sites to TV shows, there are loads of other content creators out there willing to pay good money to use your amazing clip, and may will reach out to you directly with offers.

For most, it’s a way to scratch a creative itch, to enjoy being in front of an audience and as an outlet for their talents and opinions. However, the potential to make money on YouTube is huge, and eventually any busy channel is going to start asking itself, how do YouTubers make money?</p><p>This subject is less about ‘if’ you can make money and more about how to make money on YouTube. It’s been proven time and again that the potential is there, with popular stars like Lily Singh and Roman Atwood generating around $8 million a year. And, of course, everyone’s heard of PewDiePie and his whopping $15 million income.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-earning-youtubers.jpg"                      alt="youtubers"                ></p><p>You don’t need to have a following of millions to earn money on YouTube though; even small channels have a variety of methods available to them to start making their hard work pay. If you’d like to learn how to make money on YouTube, we’re going to look at eight ways of generating an income via your videos. Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-money-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#How-to-make-money-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make money on YouTube"></a>How to make money on YouTube</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Make money on YouTube with ads</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Make money on YouTube without ads</a></li></ul><p>We’ve discovered that making money on YouTube can be split into two main categories; making money through advertising or making money without ads involved. We’ve split our article into these two categories to make it easier for you to see what your options are.</p><h3 id="Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads-3"><a href="#Make-money-on-YouTube-with-ads-3" class="headerlink" title="Make money on YouTube with ads"></a>Make money on YouTube with ads</h3><p>By far the easiest way to start earning money on YouTube is to monetize your channel using ads. Until relatively recently, anyone could enable monetization on their YouTube channel and start earning for every watch of their video. But that all changed in January this year, when Google announced they would be raising the standards required to have ads shown on your channel.</p><p>Now, you need to be part of the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which means you need to have met certain minimum criteria before you can start benefitting from ads. These include:</p><ul><li>Having 4,000 or more watch hours</li><li>Securing 1,000 or more subscribers in the last 12 months</li></ul><p>This means that, before you can even consider being a part of the YPP, you’ll need to knuckle down and grow your subscribers. There’s lots of helpful tips out there on increasing subscriber numbers, but it all boils down to creating excellent content. As they say, ‘if you build it, they will come’, so work on creating new and exciting content for your channel to get where you need to be.</p><h4 id="Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not-3"><a href="#Should-you-join-YouTube-partner-or-not-3" class="headerlink" title="Should you join YouTube partner or not?"></a>Should you join YouTube partner or not?</h4><p>Meeting the minimum requirements of the YPP is crucial to starting to host ads, but even when you’ve hit the 1k subscribers and 4k hours viewed, should you be monetizing your channel right away? Put it this way; in order to make any money from ads, you’re going to need a lot of views and loyal subscribers, which means your focus needs to be firmly on creating content rather than complying with advertising rules.</p><p>Sometimes it’s actually better to hold off for a while when you’re early on in your YouTube journey. This will mean that, rather than being distracted by the question of how to earn money from YouTube, your energy is targeted at what matters most, which is building up a library of awesome videos instead.</p><h4 id="How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform-3"><a href="#How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?"></a>How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform?</h4><p>1. Go to your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and, under <strong>Channel</strong>, select <strong>Status and features</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-creatorstudio.JPG"                      alt="monetize creatorstudio"                ></p><p>2. Click on <strong>Enable</strong> next to <strong>Monetization</strong>.</p><p>3. In the next screen, click the blue <strong>Enable my Account</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-enablescreen.JPG"                      alt="monetize enablescreen"                ></p><p>4. <strong>The YouTube Partner Program Terms</strong> will pop up. Compared to a lot of the “Terms” you are asked to read and agree to when signing up for things online the Partner Terms are fairly short and readable.</p><p>5. After reading the terms there are three boxes you will need to check to proceed. The first is to confirm that you read the Terms. The second box is a promise not to click on the ads in your own videos to try to create profits artificially.</p><p>The third box requires you to promise not monetize content that you do not own. The most extreme version of this would be stealing somebody else’s video and trying to monetize it on your channel. However, using a song or sound effect in your video you do not have the rights to also counts. There are a lot of places you can get free music to use in your monetized videos, and YouTube’s own Audio Library is one of them.</p><p>6. After you have checked all the boxes and moved on you will see a pop up explaining how to monetize your individual videos.</p><p>Your channel is now monetized, but you will not be able to earn money until you have linked your channel to your AdSense account.</p><p>7. There will be a reminder to link your channel and your AdSense account in the next screen. Click on the <strong>Link my account</strong> button. Or, go to Google.com&#x2F;adsense and click <strong>Sign Up Now</strong>. Either method will take you to the Welcome to AdSense page.</p><p>8. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> to sign in to your Google account, which is the same as your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monetize-adsense.JPG"                      alt="monetize adsense"                ></p><p>9. After you have signed in it will show you your channel url next to <strong>My website</strong> and give you a chance to change your language. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>10. The last step is to fill out all your contact information before you submit your application. Your approval should come within two days.</p><p>11. Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> and check the boxes next to all the videos you want to enable ads for.</p><p>12. Click on <strong>Actions</strong> and then select <strong>Monetize</strong>.</p><p>13. In the window that pops up you will be given a chance to choose what kinds of ads you want to allow in your videos. You must also specify here if you have included paid product placement in your video.</p><p>14. Wait for the review process to finish and ads to start appearing in your videos. If you are using any licensed, royalty free, content (like a music track) then YouTube may ask you to prove you have the rights to it.</p><h4 id="How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads-3"><a href="#How-much-you-can-get-from-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="How much you can get from Ads"></a>How much you can get from Ads</h4><p>The ad revenue generated on YouTube is split between Google and you. You’ll get 55 per cent and Google &#x2F; YouTube will take the remaining 45 per cent. This means that, if an advertiser spends $200 on your channel, you could be earning $110 directly. You’ll earn both for ‘impressions’, which is the number of views the ad received, and ‘click throughs’, which is when someone clicks on the ad for more information.</p><p>Be aware that, in order to get paid, your audience will need to have viewed at least 30 seconds of the ad, or to have clicked through to the advertiser. As a rule, around 15 per cent of viewers will convert into ad revenue, so you can start to calculate just how much your video could be worth.</p><p>To give you an example, if you enjoy daily video views in the region of 3,000 views per day and achieve click through &#x2F; view rates of the average 15 per cent, you’d be earning $0.85 - $1.40 per day or $25 - $43 a month for that one video. If you could increase your views to 5,000 per day, your monthly earnings would rise to $41 - $70 per month.</p><p>When working out how to make money on YouTube, keep in mind that every single video has the potential to earn you money. Although one video might only make a dollar a day, imagine when you’ve got 10 videos performing to the same standard, or 100. As you build up your library of content, you have the potential to earn exponentially more as time goes on.</p><p>Want to know how much you can get from Ads?

All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.</p><h2 id="3-S’well-bottle-3"><a href="#3-S’well-bottle-3" class="headerlink" title="3. S’well bottle"></a>3. S’well bottle</h2><p>S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention&#x2F;conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.</p><h2 id="4-Branded-slippers-3"><a href="#4-Branded-slippers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Branded slippers"></a>4. Branded slippers</h2><p>To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg"                      alt="Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                ></p><p><em>thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers.</em></p><h2 id="5-Pins-pins-pins-3"><a href="#5-Pins-pins-pins-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Pins, pins, pins"></a>5. Pins, pins, pins</h2><p>There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.</p><h2 id="6-Denim-jacket-3"><a href="#6-Denim-jacket-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Denim jacket"></a>6. Denim jacket</h2><p>A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.</p><p>_ <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg"                      alt="Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit"                > _</p><p><em>Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit.</em></p><p>Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!</p><p>Want to join the YouTube Creator Summit in the future?

Make sure that you go through them!</p><ul><li><strong>Increased SEO Opportunities</strong></li></ul><p>The use of <strong>YouTube Timestamps</strong> can be regarded as a very useful SEO video hack. The ranking of YouTube videos is completely based on the watch time and retention of the audience. Hence, when a user clicks on the Timestamp, YouTube will log this as two views. The initial click counts as the first view. Next will be the second view, which is the Timestamped moment of the video. This 2-on-1 benefit helps in increasing the video ranking.</p><p>Now, it is time for all the YouTube creators to switch to this feature for higher rankings. This will take off in 2021, particularly amongst the mobile phone users, since now even Google supports Timestamp hyperlinks. Timestamps will become increasingly important for YouTubers in the coming year.</p><ul><li><strong>User Experience Enhanced</strong></li></ul><p>Jumbling for a specific part of a video can be annoying for the user, and they might end up closing it. Anyone would not certainly want to watch the entire 15 minutes of video for nugget-sized information. Hence, using Timestamps is indeed a benefit for you. With this feature, you can now overcome this issue and get a huge victory of an increase in the count of viewers.</p><ul><li><strong>Perk for the Mobile Users</strong></li></ul><p>Google has started rewarding the Timestamps for the YouTube videos. It appears to be paying attention to the Timestamps on the videos and then linking to each chapter or header in the YouTube description.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Should-I-Add-Timestamps-to-All-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-5-Should-I-Add-Timestamps-to-All-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Should I Add Timestamps to All YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 5: Should I Add Timestamps to All YouTube Videos?</h2><p>Almost every video put up on the internet is designed so as to get optimized as per the SEO trends. Google has mentioned it clearly that “<a class="link"   href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/key-moments-video-search/" >how-to videos which have multiple steps, should have Timestamps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.” However, the truth is that every video which is long and has multiple pointers or steps in it should have the <strong>YouTube Timestamps</strong> in it.</p><p>From product reviews to the help tutorials, can reap benefits from this feature of YouTube. This is something you should think about before you start adding chapters to your video.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>One of the most effective methods to boost visibility about your brand or product is to create entertaining content online. Using Timestamps in your videos, you may enhance the ranking of your video, enhance the viewer experience, and develop long-term partnerships with a larger audience. You can certainly try experimenting with YouTube at any point in your video and see what happens.</p><p>Comment below with your opinions on the results of this new feature and how you feel it impacts your business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Mystery-of-Unlisted-Content-on-YouTube-Explored"><a href="#The-Mystery-of-Unlisted-Content-on-YouTube-Explored" class="headerlink" title="The Mystery of Unlisted Content on YouTube Explored"></a>The Mystery of Unlisted Content on YouTube Explored</h2><h1 id="Complete-Guide-What-Does-Unlisted-Mean-on-YouTube"><a href="#Complete-Guide-What-Does-Unlisted-Mean-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Complete Guide: What Does Unlisted Mean on YouTube"></a>Complete Guide: What Does Unlisted Mean on YouTube</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-4"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-4" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Whether personal or professional purposes, YouTube is a great platform for sharing videos but, there are times, when you don’t wish to share it with each and everyone across the globe.

The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise <strong>video upload requirements</strong>, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be <strong>saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>.</p><p>YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to <strong>upload a YouTube video to IGTV</strong> and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading.

There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools.

Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media.

It triggers a pop-up asking them to confirm their subscription. If they were already interested enough to click the link and check out your channel they may confirm the subscription in the window, whereas they may forget to subscribe if they aren’t prompted.</p><p>A YouTube subscribe link is one of the best ways to share a link on your website, in social media posts, or anywhere you mention your channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-YouTube-Subscribe-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link"></a>How to Get a YouTube Subscribe Link</h2><p>YouTube subscribe links aren’t some kind of exclusive perk – anyone can have one!</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your YouTube channel page and click into the address bar so you can edit the URL.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following to the end of your channel URL:</p><p>?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the entire URL including the part you added and paste it into a word document to save. Any time you share a link to your channel, make sure it is this link.</p><p>This will work both with channels that have custom URLs and channels which do not. Here’s an example:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>That’s a link for Wondershare Filmora Video Editor’s YouTube channel. With the modifier it looks like this:</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY/_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub%5C_confirmation=1" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY\_LMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w?sub\_confirmation=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>Getting subscribers is tough, but you’ll get more if you ask and this is just another way of asking.

It’s a great way of showcasing your followers and subscribers your personal style, how you shop and what your favorite stores are. Keeping in mind the mantras used by famous haul video creators, we’ve gathered a step-by-step guide below using which you can instantly create a catchy try-on haul video.</p><h3 id="1-Create-a-good-setup"><a href="#1-Create-a-good-setup" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a good setup"></a>1. Create a good setup</h3><p>Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.</p><h3 id="2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment"><a href="#2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment" class="headerlink" title="2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment"></a>2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment</h3><p>Put your camera on a flat surface if available. You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.</p><p>You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.</p><h3 id="3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better"><a href="#3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better" class="headerlink" title="3. Speak clearly and perform better"></a>3. Speak clearly and perform better</h3><p>Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don’t want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you’re comfortable presenting in front of a camera.</p><p>Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple “Hello, everyone!”), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.</p><p>Act as if you’re directly conversing with one of your friends – it’s one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.</p><h3 id="4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought"><a href="#4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought" class="headerlink" title="4. Clearly show off the products you bought"></a>4. Clearly show off the products you bought</h3><p>Show off the products you got! Hold the camera and show them to the audience in depth. You can also describe why you purchased each item, the price, plus any special discounts. Moreover, it is a great idea to keep all of your receipts and bills.</p><h3 id="5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor"><a href="#5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor"></a>5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor</h3><p>Use a video editing program to revamp your raw footage and make it look more professional. In excitement, you’d want to upload it as quickly as you can, but it’s better to invest a little time editing it so that you can publish a video with superb quality.</p><p>If there are any sections in your video that you don’t look for in the finished product, you can remove them. Plus, you can add special effects such as floating text and captions. All of this can be instantly done with the beginner-friendly and popular video editing program by Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>Within the new era of Filmora! Wondershare Filmora X is here with features like keyframing, motion tracking, audio ducking, and more. The audio ducking element is reliable for haul videos, notably as it lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears.

Share among social network</h3><p>If you have a social network page or a blog that you would like your YouTube viewers to consider worth checking, you can create short-form content either at the beginning or end of the video, with the short message and a URL. They’ll indeed check out your blog if your subscribers enjoy your content! And, it’s a friendly manner to build an audience and get traffic to your other pages!</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Our final verdict is that haul videos are just entertaining to make and fun to watch with all the discussion above!

This type of content can offer immense benefits to both influencers and small retail businesses.</p><p>Though they may not be quite as existent as they once were, it’s still essential to know the potential effect of these try-on-haul videos. They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience.

They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.</p><p>Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006&#x2F;2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn’t that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.</p><p>Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-2"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?"></a><strong>Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?</strong></h2><p>Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.</p><p>They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.</p><p>So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.</p><p>On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience. If you have a YouTube channel, Instagram account, Facebook page, or blog, providing insights on the products you love can help your audience shape their own purchasing decisions.</p><p>It also creates a natural way to infuse some brand-related content into your content creation strategy.

This type of content can offer immense benefits to both influencers and small retail businesses.</p><p>Though they may not be quite as existent as they once were, it’s still essential to know the potential effect of these try-on-haul videos. They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience. Here’s a quick guide to learn the ins and outs of haul videos.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is a Haul Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Why is Haul Videos Popular?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Get Inspired from Fashion YouTubers to Find Out the Point of Try on Hauls</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Make a Catchy Haul Video?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Haul-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Haul-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Haul Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is a Haul Video?</strong></h2><p>Generally, a haul video is a recording of someone showcasing a collection of purchases. They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.</p><p>Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006&#x2F;2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn’t that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.</p><p>Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Haul-Videos-Popular-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?"></a><strong>Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?</strong></h2><p>Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.</p><p>They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.</p><p>So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.</p><p>On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience. If you have a YouTube channel, Instagram account, Facebook page, or blog, providing insights on the products you love can help your audience shape their own purchasing decisions.</p><p>It also creates a natural way to infuse some brand-related content into your content creation strategy. This can lead to profitable connections for your business in the future.</p><p>And since we’re very much intrigued by the glorifying fast fashion, excessive materialism, and hoarding, I’m getting my hands dirty with information.

It’s a great way of showcasing your followers and subscribers your personal style, how you shop and what your favorite stores are. Keeping in mind the mantras used by famous haul video creators, we’ve gathered a step-by-step guide below using which you can instantly create a catchy try-on haul video.</p><h3 id="1-Create-a-good-setup-3"><a href="#1-Create-a-good-setup-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a good setup"></a>1. Create a good setup</h3><p>Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.</p><h3 id="2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-3"><a href="#2-Do-a-test-video-first-with-your-shooting-equipment-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment"></a>2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment</h3><p>Put your camera on a flat surface if available. You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.</p><p>You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.</p><h3 id="3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-3"><a href="#3-Speak-clearly-and-perform-better-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Speak clearly and perform better"></a>3. Speak clearly and perform better</h3><p>Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don’t want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you’re comfortable presenting in front of a camera.</p><p>Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple “Hello, everyone!”), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.</p><p>Act as if you’re directly conversing with one of your friends – it’s one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.</p><h3 id="4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-3"><a href="#4-Clearly-show-off-the-products-you-bought-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Clearly show off the products you bought"></a>4. Clearly show off the products you bought</h3><p>Show off the products you got! Hold the camera and show them to the audience in depth. You can also describe why you purchased each item, the price, plus any special discounts. Moreover, it is a great idea to keep all of your receipts and bills.</p><h3 id="5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor-3"><a href="#5-Don’t-forget-to-use-an-ideal-video-editor-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor"></a>5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor</h3><p>Use a video editing program to revamp your raw footage and make it look more professional. In excitement, you’d want to upload it as quickly as you can, but it’s better to invest a little time editing it so that you can publish a video with superb quality.</p><p>If there are any sections in your video that you don’t look for in the finished product, you can remove them. Plus, you can add special effects such as floating text and captions. All of this can be instantly done with the beginner-friendly and popular video editing program by Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>Within the new era of Filmora! Wondershare Filmora X is here with features like keyframing, motion tracking, audio ducking, and more. The audio ducking element is reliable for haul videos, notably as it lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears. And, this can be implemented in different ways while editing the video.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng"                ></p><h3 id="6-Share-among-social-network-3"><a href="#6-Share-among-social-network-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

And, it’s a friendly manner to build an audience and get traffic to your other pages!</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Our final verdict is that haul videos are just entertaining to make and fun to watch with all the discussion above!

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers.

Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision-1"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-1"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-1"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-1"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros-1"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers-1"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media-1"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments-1"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-6"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-6" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Nov 01, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>In the ten years that I’ve been a YouTuber, I’ve made a lot of mistakes.

You get the chance to grow by being introduced to your partner’s audience, you make a friend to support and be supported by as you both grow your channels, and it always looks like a ton of fun. The question isn’t why you should collab, it’s how.</p><p>Finding someone to collab with, approaching them, and figuring out how to actually make the video can be all be challenging.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own! It’s from filmora.io’s free YouTube Toolkit, which you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-youtube-subscribers" >download with the Get Subs Guide here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are some more tips:</p><h4 id="1-Use-Their-Name"><a href="#1-Use-Their-Name" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Pitch Video Ideas"></a><strong>3. Pitch Video Ideas</strong></h4><p>You should have a couple of ideas for videos you could do together ready when you contact someone. You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep Your Message Simple"></a><strong>4. Keep Your Message Simple</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a huge amount of text the first time you contact them. Check out the example at the beginning of this section to get an idea of the length you should go for.</p><h4 id="5-Be-an-Equal"><a href="#5-Be-an-Equal" class="headerlink" title="5. Be an Equal"></a><strong>5. Be an Equal</strong></h4><p>Remember that you are just as wonderful a creator as the person you are approaching. You don’t want to fawn too heavily and cast yourself more as a fan than a serious creator in your own right (not that you can’t be both).</p><h4 id="6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page"><a href="#6-Most-Creators-Have-an-Email-Address-on-Their-Channel-Page" class="headerlink" title="6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page"></a><strong>6. Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media. If you use a platform like Twitter, however, you may want to be a bit more casual and start a conversation before building up to asking them about a collab.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Collab-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Collab Video"></a><strong>How to Make a Collab Video</strong></h2><p>Here are 3 ways you can collaborate with other YouTubers.</p><h4 id="Shout-Each-Other-Out"><a href="#Shout-Each-Other-Out" class="headerlink" title="Shout Each Other Out"></a><strong>Shout Each Other Out</strong></h4><p>This is the easiest way to collab because you don’t have to meet up or do much planning together.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-1"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-1"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-1"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-1"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

That’s a mistake in this scenario.

Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-1"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You don’t want to reach out to someone and then seem like you expect them to do all the planning. You may not end up doing one of the ideas you pitch, but you’ll still come off better if you have something in mind when you first send your message.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-1"><a href="#4-Keep-Your-Message-Simple-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most Creators Have an Email Address on Their Channel Page</strong></h4><p>It usually isn’t difficult to find contact information for a YouTuber. If you go to someone’s channel page and click into the About tab, there will usually be a section called ‘For business inquiries’ under ‘Details’. Click ‘View Email Address’ next to that and you’ll have a means of contacting the person you want to collaborate with.</p><p>You can also reach out through DMs or other social media.

Who Are My Friends?"></a><strong>1. Who Are My Friends?</strong></h4><p>The easiest way to think of a potential collab partner is just to think of who you’re already friendly with. The best place to look for collab partners is probably in your list of subscribers. Someone who already knows what you do and enjoys it will probably be receptive to the idea of doing a video with you.</p><p>You can even sort your own subscribers by their sub counts to find someone with about the same sized channel as you.</p><h4 id="2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-3"><a href="#2-Who’s-In-The-Same-Boat-as-Me-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?"></a><strong>2. Who’s In The Same Boat as Me?</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to already have a friendship, or even a creator-subscriber, relationship with someone to consider them as a potential partner (although it’s not a bad idea to subscribe to them before you send your request).</p><p>Consider people who are in the same niche as you who have approximately the same sized channel as you. If you’re in different genres the collab doesn’t make sense, and if there’s a significant size difference between your channels then it’s a lot more valuable to one of you than the other.</p><h4 id="3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-3"><a href="#3-What-Can-This-Person-Offer-My-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?"></a><strong>3. What Can This Person Offer My Audience?</strong></h4><p>Part of why you collaborate is to grow your audience, but that should never be at the expense of your current subscriber base. Before you reach out to a potential collab partner, seriously consider whether you think your audience will enjoy a video that features them.</p><p>Your partner should be someone who delivers content that is relevant to your own audience (for example, it makes no sense for a tech YouTuber to collaborate with someone whose channel is about cupcakes – their techie audience doesn’t want to learn about cupcakes).</p><h4 id="4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-3"><a href="#4-Do-I-Like-Their-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Do I Like Their Videos?"></a><strong>4. Do I Like Their Videos?</strong></h4><p>Before you send anyone a message, make sure you’ve watched and enjoyed a few of their videos. If you don’t find them entertaining then your audience probably won’t either. Also, if you don’t seem to have any knowledge of someone’s content then they probably won’t want to work with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-3"><a href="#5-What-Kind-of-Videos-Could-We-Make-3" class="headerlink" title="5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?"></a><strong>5. What Kind of Videos Could We Make?</strong></h4><p>The time to start brainstorming is not after you’ve already sent a collab request. You should think of a few ideas before you reach out, both to show your potential partner that you’re serious and to ensure that your audience is getting well-planned content.</p><h4 id="6-Who’s-in-My-Area-3"><a href="#6-Who’s-in-My-Area-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Who’s in My Area?"></a><strong>6. Who’s in My Area?</strong></h4><p>You can do a long-distance collab, but if it is possible to physically meet up with someone to plan and shoot the videos then that’s way better.</p><h2 id="How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-3"><a href="#How-to-Ask-Someone-to-Collab-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Ask Someone to Collab"></a><strong>How to Ask Someone to Collab</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collab-pitch-examples.jpg"                      alt="collab pitch examples"                ></p><p>Here’s an example of a collab pitch, and a template you can use to write your own!

Use Their Name"></a><strong>1. Use Their Name</strong></h4><p>This one probably seems basic, but it is very easy to send a message where you just say ‘hey’ and jump to your point without actually using someone’s name. That’s a mistake in this scenario. You want to let your potential partner know that you are specifically interested in working with them and aren’t just fishing for anyone who might work with you.</p><h4 id="2-Mention-Their-Content-3"><a href="#2-Mention-Their-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Mention Their Content"></a><strong>2. Mention Their Content</strong></h4><p>Show an interest in your future partner’s videos. You should have watched at least a couple of them as part of deciding to reach out, so mention a video of theirs that you liked and talk about why. Let the other person know that you genuinely enjoy what they do and think your audience will too.</p><h4 id="3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-3"><a href="#3-Pitch-Video-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical.

In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical. For your videos to achieve meaningful results, it’s important to view each as distinct from the other.

For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

This live streaming platform takes your experience to another level. You can use it to make crafts, play games, attract broadcasters, and many more. Twitch was launched in 2011, and since then, it has attracted millions of users, managing a database of about 4 million broadcasters by early 2020. With it, users can stream their activities as others watch in real-time. Just browse a category to find a stream.</p><p>You can also follow streamers that you like on the platform and get updates and notifications immediately after they are posted. But how do you start a career on a platform like Twitch? You need to broadcast and gather a large following. You can use built-in audiences from other platforms like Facebook. Let’s dive into the core of the matter and look at <strong>how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube</strong> and build your platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-1.png"                      alt="how to upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Twitch VOD?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube</a></p><h2 id="What-is-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#What-is-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="What is Twitch VOD?"></a>What is Twitch VOD?</h2><p>Twitch Video on Demand (VOD) is a recording of previously streamed content. It provides briefings if you missed catching the Twitch live stream. Just watch the VOD from your favorite streamer and be engaged the best way possible. However, VODs don’t last forever. They are removed after two weeks of broadcast. But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.</p><h4 id="How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="- How to enable Twitch VOD?"></a>- How to enable Twitch VOD?</h4><p>VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They’ll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch</strong><br>Check in the “Channel &amp; Video” section and locate the “Stream Key &amp; Preferences” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-2.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Click on “Creator Dashboard”</strong><br>Remember, you can enable VODs from your creator dashboard. Just go under the “Settings” tab and click on the “Stream section” of the creator dashboard. Check under the subtitle “VOD Settings” and get the option to store past broadcasts. You can also toggle the slider to store your past broadcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-3.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - click on creator dashboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 Click on the “Settings” tab on the left-hand side and go to Stream</strong><br>You’ll get various drop-down menu options. Click on the “Settings” tab and choose the “Stream” option. The system will navigate to a new page, thus setting your preferences for VODs and clips.</p><p><strong>Step 4. Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”</strong><br>Ensure you have the toggle option turned ON under the “VOD Settings.” If it’s “ON,” you’ll realize the toggle will be purple, with a checkmark in it. Twitch will be confirmed to be enabled if it’s purple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-4.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - how to store twitch vod"                ></p><h4 id="Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD" class="headerlink" title="- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD"></a>- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD</h4><p>These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.</p><h5 id="1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD"><a href="#1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD" class="headerlink" title="1. How long will Twitch store my VOD"></a>1. How long will Twitch store my VOD</h5><p>Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.</p><p>Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.</p><h5 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips"></a>2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips</h5><p>Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don’t need any additional requirements to use VOD.</p><p>Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.</p><ul><li>To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.</li><li>Then scroll down and click on “Content” &gt; “Video Producer.</li><li>Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”</li><li>Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”</li><li>Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.</li><li>Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.</li></ul><p>When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.</p><p>The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer’s channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.</p><ul><li>To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.</li><li>Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.</li><li>Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You’ll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip’s link to other social media networks.</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube"><a href="#What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube"></a>What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</h2><p>You stand to gain a lot when you upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube.</p><h4 id="1-To-enlighten-your-followers"><a href="#1-To-enlighten-your-followers" class="headerlink" title="1) To enlighten your followers"></a>1) To enlighten your followers</h4><p>Your followers will see your streams and make the best decisions. Viewers can check out your recordings and other highlights from past streams. It will help them decide whether they like what they see and probably join your live streams.</p><h4 id="2-Twitch-provides-content-for-you-to-share-and-monetize-on-YouTube"><a href="#2-Twitch-provides-content-for-you-to-share-and-monetize-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2) Twitch provides content for you to share and monetize on YouTube"></a>2) Twitch provides content for you to share and monetize on YouTube</h4><p>Since Twitch streaming is more popular nowadays, many people throng it for content. It is not wise to rely entirely on Twitch to discover as a Twitch Streamer. Posting to YouTube will make it known within a short time. You would have announced your streams most nobly and kept your followers up to date, attracting new ones as well.</p><h4 id="3-To-keep-your-followers-engaged-even-when-you-are-offline"><a href="#3-To-keep-your-followers-engaged-even-when-you-are-offline" class="headerlink" title="3) To keep your followers engaged even when you are offline"></a>3) To keep your followers engaged even when you are offline</h4><p>Even though live streaming is important, some viewers may not attend the live sessions due to different time zones or other commitments. In this regard, when uploaded to YouTube, Twitch will give them a chance to watch your content just whenever they log in. They, therefore, have the option to watch a Twitch VOD of the live stream they missed.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube"></a>How to upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube</h2><p>Check how to upload Twitch streams to YouTube from the Twitch website.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Identify the little arrow next to your name on the Twitch website and click on it.

But streamers with Partner Status can have their VODs last up to 60 days.</p><h4 id="How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD-3"><a href="#How-to-enable-Twitch-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="- How to enable Twitch VOD?"></a>- How to enable Twitch VOD?</h4><p>VODs are the best form to archive streams that your fans missed. Even though they are not enabled by default, you can manually enable them and not let your fans miss any important event from your channel. They’ll find it under the “Videos” tab on any Twitch channel. Follow these steps to enable VOD on your channel.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner of Twitch</strong><br>Check in the “Channel &amp; Video” section and locate the “Stream Key &amp; Preferences” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-2.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Click on “Creator Dashboard”</strong><br>Remember, you can enable VODs from your creator dashboard. Just go under the “Settings” tab and click on the “Stream section” of the creator dashboard. Check under the subtitle “VOD Settings” and get the option to store past broadcasts. You can also toggle the slider to store your past broadcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-3.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - click on creator dashboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 Click on the “Settings” tab on the left-hand side and go to Stream</strong><br>You’ll get various drop-down menu options.

Go to “VOD Settings” and toggle on the “Store Past Broadcast.”</strong><br>Ensure you have the toggle option turned ON under the “VOD Settings.” If it’s “ON,” you’ll realize the toggle will be purple, with a checkmark in it. Twitch will be confirmed to be enabled if it’s purple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-twitch-stream-to-youtube-4.png"                      alt="upload twitch stream to youtube - how to store twitch vod"                ></p><h4 id="Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD-3"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Question-about-Twitch-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD"></a>- Frequently Asked Question about Twitch VOD</h4><p>These are some questions frequently asked by Twitch users.</p><h5 id="1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD-3"><a href="#1-How-long-will-Twitch-store-my-VOD-3" class="headerlink" title="1. How long will Twitch store my VOD"></a>1. How long will Twitch store my VOD</h5><p>Your Twitch can either be stored for 14 or 60 days, depending on your level. For Twitch Prime, Twitch Partner or a Twitch Turbo user has their past broadcasts automatically saved for 60 days before deletion. But if you are not connected to these three options, your past broadcasts will be saved for only 14 days before deletion.</p><p>Since your past broadcasts cannot be live for more than 60 days, you have the option to download the video to your computer before the validity days expire and Twitch deletes it. You can use an External Hard drive to save the past broadcast content. Likewise, it is possible to turn your past broadcast content into Highlight and, in turn, permanently store them on Twitch.</p><h5 id="2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-difference-between-Twitch-VOD-Highlights-and-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips"></a>2. What is the difference between Twitch VOD, Highlights, and Clips</h5><p>Twitch VOD is a previously saved video of your live stream content. You choose to save either part or the entire content of your previously streamed content. More so, you don’t need any additional requirements to use VOD.</p><p>Highlights are short videos that have been edited from your past broadcast content. You can save them on Twitch permanently. Streamers majorly use highlights to save video game achievements. Unlike VOD Twitch that can be saved up to 60 days, Highlights usually lasts no more than 3 minutes.</p><ul><li>To make Highlights on Twitch, first, navigate to your Dashboard.</li><li>Then scroll down and click on “Content” &gt; “Video Producer.</li><li>Next, press on “All Videos” to change them to “Past Broadcasts.”</li><li>Now press the “Highlight” button, and Twitch will immediately open a new tab for “Twitch Highlighter Tool.”</li><li>Then select the video part to include as “Highlight” and press the “Create Highlights” button.</li><li>Wait a while for the process to be completed, and Voila! You have your Highlights created.</li></ul><p>When it comes to Twitch Clip, you can capture special moments in a stream you are currently watching. On the same note, you can share clips with friends and other users on social media platforms. Such shared clips contain a link where others view the source or video from.</p><p>The clips you create will automatically be saved on the streamer’s channel on the “Clips” page, where other viewers can see them too. Nonetheless, you can download “clips” to your computer and, in turn, upload them whenever you want to. And note that you can help your stream grow via “Clips” by letting your viewers clip and share your stream moments.</p><ul><li>To create “Clips” on Twitch, identify which Streamers channel you wish to create a clip from.</li><li>Then click on the “Clapper board” icon. Next, edit your clip between 5 and 60 seconds long.</li><li>Finally, create a title and publish your Clip. You’ll also enjoy the privilege to share your clip’s link to other social media networks.</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube-3"><a href="#What-is-the-benefit-of-uploading-your-Twitch-Streams-to-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube"></a>What is the benefit of uploading your Twitch Streams to YouTube</h2><p>You stand to gain a lot when you upload your Twitch Streams to YouTube.</p><h4 id="1-To-enlighten-your-followers-3"><a href="#1-To-enlighten-your-followers-3" class="headerlink" title="1) To enlighten your followers"></a>1) To enlighten your followers</h4><p>Your followers will see your streams and make the best decisions.

However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p><p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like.

Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p><p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p><p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p><h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is an Unboxing Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Unboxing Videos</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness.

Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng"                ></p><h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox" class="headerlink" title="2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox"></a>2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p><p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p><h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p><p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time" class="headerlink" title="4.

Select an Unboxing Niche</p><p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p><p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p><p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p><p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p><p>6. Show the Product in Use</p><p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p><p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p><p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p><h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p><p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p><p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="filmorax boxpng"                ></p><h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p><p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p><h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p><p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p><h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-1"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p><p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it.

However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p><p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p><p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p><p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p><p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p><p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p><p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p><h4 id="In-this-article-7"><a href="#In-this-article-7" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is an Unboxing Video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs about Unboxing Videos</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p><p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p><p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p><p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand.

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth.

In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results.
