Most of the improvements center around enhancing user interaction, new functionalities, and improving overall performance, and there are heaps of reasons why you should give them a try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Input-and-Output-Capabilities"><a href="#Image-Input-and-Output-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Image Input and Output Capabilities"></a>Image Input and Output Capabilities</h2><p> ChatGPT is now capable of taking images as input and generating images as output! The new image input capability allows users to upload images directly into their chat interactions with ChatGPT. This feature expands the ways users can seek help and share information, making it possible to discuss visual content seamlessly.</p><p> In this example, I asked ChatGPT for recipes for the items visible in the fridge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/asking-chatgpt-for-recipes.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to identify and make recipes for ingredients based on an image"                ></p><p> It gave me some pretty accurate results in identifying items in the fridge and giving recipes I could make using the ingredients identified.</p><p> Aside from taking images as input, ChatGPT can also generate DALL-E images within the interaction.</p><p>I asked ChatGPT what MakeUseOf would look like if it were a robot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-16-161949.jpg"                      alt="Asking ChatGPT to generate an image using text description"                ></p><p> As you can see, ChatGPT provides some promising results, providing an image plus a description of the image. However, it still seems like you’ll need to use <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-convert-dalle-3-webp-images-jpg-or-png/" >third-party solutions to save the image in JPG or PNG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , since there isn’t a way to save the image beside WebP.</p><p> ChatGPT Plus users were immediately given access to the new features using OpenAI’s new ChatGPT-4o (Omnimodal) model. Free-tier users will also have access to these features but with limited usage.</p><h2 id="Expanded-Knowledge-Base-and-Cross-Chat-Memory"><a href="#Expanded-Knowledge-Base-and-Cross-Chat-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Expanded Knowledge Base and Cross-Chat Memory"></a>Expanded Knowledge Base and Cross-Chat Memory</h2><p> ChatGPT’s upgraded web browsing capabilities allow it to retrieve up-to-date information from the web with better accuracy. It ensures responses are based on the latest available data and insights, making it particularly valuable for quickly evolving topics like news, technology, and market trends.</p><p> In addition to web browsing capabilities, ChatGPT’s memory feature is now generally available. The memory feature allows ChatGPT to retain details about your preferences, past interactions, and ongoing projects, providing a more personalized and coherent user experience. This means that ChatGPT can remember your favorite topics, tailor its responses to suit your needs and keep track of long-term projects or ongoing conversations.</p><p> I asked ChatGPT to check the Saturday weather forecast and advise whether I should reschedule my activities based on the weather update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/using-chatgpt-as-assistant-using-expanded-knowledge-base-1-1.jpg"                      alt="Using ChatGPT as an AI assistant using memory and web browsing features"                ></p><p> ChatGPT provided sound advice by browsing the web for the weather and reviewing its memory of my schedule. It even gave me a list of activities I could do instead based on my past interactions with ChatGPT.</p><p> The browsing capability feature is now available for both Plus and Free tier users, while ChatGPT Memory is only available to Plus users.</p><h2 id="Multi-Modal-Voice-and-Video-Interactions"><a href="#Multi-Modal-Voice-and-Video-Interactions" class="headerlink" title="Multi-Modal Voice and Video Interactions"></a>Multi-Modal Voice and Video Interactions</h2><p> Everyone <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-5-features-we-want-to-see/" >wanted to see more modality in ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The new ChatGPT-4o model gives access to multi-modal voice and video interaction, allowing users to engage in continuous voice and video conversations with ChatGPT, like making a video call with a human assistant. ChatGPT-4o’s conversation support, video capability, and human-like voice and emotions make this new feature different from other voice assistants.</p><p> In the video, ChatGPT talked with the hosts, showing varying levels of emotions. Furthermore, the hosts were also able to interrupt ChatGPT mid-conversation, allowing for real-time conversations with little delay.</p><p> Pairing this feature with ChatGPT’s browsing and memory functionality allows for a highly versatile AI companion. This enhanced version of ChatGPT can now better assist you with shopping, planning, and organizing. GPT-4o’s conversation functionality makes it possible to use ChatGPT as a hands-free assistant using voice commands, making it easier to interact with the AI while you’re on the go or multitasking.</p><p> GPT-4o’s voice interaction is available to all users using the ChatGPT Android&#x2F;iOS app. However, the video interaction feature is unavailable at the time of writing but is expected to roll out in the near future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Upgraded-Code-Analysis"><a href="#Upgraded-Code-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Upgraded Code Analysis"></a>Upgraded Code Analysis</h2><p> The previous ChatGPT Code Interpreter is now called Advanced Data Analysis (ADA). Since it is already out of beta and ChatGPT plugins are no longer available, ADA is now an integrated feature within both ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o, and both Free and Plus tier users now have this feature. No plugin or activation is needed; simply prompt ChatGPT to run, analyze, or write code, and it should do the rest for you.</p><p> Here, I’ve given ChatGPT-4o an SQL file containing a database from an e-commerce project and asked it to analyze and graph the top products commonly ordered.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/using-chatgpt-advanced-data-analysis.jpg"                      alt="Using-ChatGPT-Advanced-Data-Analysis"                ></p><p> I already knew the numbers before running it using ADA on ChatGPT-4o, so I know the provided graph is accurate. However, running it on ChatGPT-4 continually gave me errors, was slow, and never really provided me with the graph. So, although ADA is not functionally different from the old code interpreter, running ADA right on ChatGPT-4o was certainly easier, faster, and smarter.</p><p> OpenAI’s demonstrations also showed live code debugging using voice commands, which is another enormous upgrade for ChatGPT. Instead of having to type commands and work bit by bit, live interactions with your code could speed up the process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Temporary-Chat"><a href="#Temporary-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Chat"></a>Temporary Chat</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chatgpt-s-temporary-chat-feature.png"                      alt="ChatGPT&#39;s new temporary chat feature"                ></p><p> The new Temporary Chat feature in ChatGPT-4o is ideal for privacy-conscious users and those seeking quick interactions with ChatGPT. This feature enables users to engage in a temporary chat with ChatGPT without the conversation being saved in history or used by OpenAI to train their models.</p><p> Temporary Chat is available to both Plus and Free tier users. You can access it through the model drop-down menu by selecting the Temporary Chat option. Once activated, you can now enjoy a private and non-persistent chat experience.</p><p> The latest updates to ChatGPT introduce a host of features that cater to a wide range of user needs, from enhanced interactivity and data analysis to real-time information access and personalized experiences. Whether you’re a professional, student, or casual user, these features offer powerful new ways to leverage ChatGPT for improved productivity, learning, and everyday convenience.</p><p><ins

One such issue is the dreaded low memory warning that affects some iPhone users. But what exactly is this error, and how can you fix it? Here’s everything you need to know.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-Warning"><a href="#What-Is-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-Warning" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Roblox Low Memory Warning?"></a>What Is the Roblox Low Memory Warning?</h2><p> Roblox throws a low memory warning when your iPhone runs low on memory. When this warning appears, you’ll see the following message on the screen:</p><blockquote><p>Your device’s memory is low. Leaving now will preserve your state and prevent Roblox from crashing. (Error Code:292)</p></blockquote><p> Roblox developers recommend leaving the game immediately when this error appears. Doing so ensures that your state is saved and your Roblox avatar is in the position of your choice before you leave the game. You can also choose to keep playing the game, but the probability is very high that the game will crash automatically after a few seconds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Troubleshooting-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-iPhone-Warning"><a href="#Troubleshooting-the-Roblox-Low-Memory-iPhone-Warning" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting the Roblox Low Memory iPhone Warning"></a>Troubleshooting the Roblox Low Memory iPhone Warning</h2><p> The Roblox low memory warning usually appears as a temporary glitch and can be easily fixed by restarting the game. However, if you encounter this issue frequently, you can try some of the troubleshooting steps we’ve outlined below.</p><h3 id="1-Check-Device-Compatibility"><a href="#1-Check-Device-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Device Compatibility"></a>1. Check Device Compatibility</h3><p> You will regularly encounter the low memory warning on Roblox if your device is not fully compatible with the game. An iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, or later is required to play Roblox.</p><p> Additionally, it’s worth <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-iphone-ios-apps-data/" >updating your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you haven’t already to avoid iOS-related bugs from causing the low memory warning.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Close-Unnecessary-Background-Apps"><a href="#2-Close-Unnecessary-Background-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Close Unnecessary Background Apps"></a>2. Close Unnecessary Background Apps</h3><p> Another way to fix the Roblox low memory warning is to close any unnecessary apps running in the background. Apps running in the background can constantly use device memory, leaving foreground apps like Roblox with limited memory. This is especially common on older iPhones, such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, which only have 1GB of RAM.</p><p> So, close all unnecessary apps running in the background and see if that resolves the Roblox low memory issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

Reduce In-Game Graphics"></a>3. Reduce In-Game Graphics</h3><p> If closing unnecessary apps in the background doesn’t help, you can reduce the game’s graphics quality to resolve the Roblox low memory issue.</p><p> To do this, open the Roblox game that’s causing the issue and tap the<strong>Roblox</strong> icon in the top-left corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/roblox-icon.jpg"                      alt="Roblox gameplay on iPhone"                ></p><p> Then, switch to the<strong>Settings</strong> tab, change the Graphics Mode to<strong>Manual</strong> , and tap the<strong>minus (-)</strong> icon next to the Graphics Quality option to lower the visual fidelity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/graphics-quality-option.jpg"                      alt="Graphics Quality option in Roblox game settings"                ></p><p> After that, tap the<strong>X</strong> icon in the top-left corner and restart the game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png"                      border="0"                >Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Enjoy-Your-Favorite-Roblox-Game-Without-Interruptions"><a href="#Enjoy-Your-Favorite-Roblox-Game-Without-Interruptions" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Your Favorite Roblox Game Without Interruptions"></a>Enjoy Your Favorite Roblox Game Without Interruptions</h2><p> Hopefully, you managed to play a few Roblox games without the low memory warning appearing on the screen.

Investigating Contemporary Substitutes for the Traditional Turing Challenge</h2><p> Over 70 years ago, when artificial intelligence was conceptualized, Alan Turing published a paper that described how to identify it. It was later known as the Turing test, and it has been used for decades to distinguish between a human and an AI.</p><p> However, with the introduction of advanced AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it’s becoming more difficult to tell if you’re talking to an AI. It begs the question; is the Turing test outdated? And if it is, what are the alternatives?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >Greeting Card Builder</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated"><a href="#Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Is the Turing Test Outdated?"></a>Is the Turing Test Outdated?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-questions-robot-turing-test-example-feature.jpg"                      alt="man questions robot turing test example feature"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jesus Sanz&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-scientist-facing-turing-test-artificial-1651840888" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To determine if the Turing test is outdated, you must first<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/" >understand how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For an AI to pass the Turing test, it must convince a human interrogator that it’s a human. But there is a catch—the AI is evaluated alongside a human, and it must respond using text.</p><p> Think of it like this; if you’re the interrogator, and you’re asking questions to two participants online using text, but one of them is an AI model—would you tell them apart after five minutes? Keep in mind that the objective of the Turing test is not to identify the AI model based on the correct answers but to evaluate if the AI can think or behave like a human.</p><p> The problem with the Turing test approach of only identifying human-like responses is that it doesn’t consider other factors. For instance, the intelligence of the AI model or the knowledge of the interrogator. Besides that, the Turing test is limited to text only, and it’s becoming more difficult to identify an AI that generates a human voice or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-deepfakes-explained/" >deepfake videos that imitate human behavior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, the current AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard haven’t yet advanced to a point they can consistently pass the Turing test.

If that happens, we would need different tests combined with the Turing test to identify if we’re talking to an AI or a human. Here are the best Turing test alternatives:</p><h2 id="1-The-Marcus-Test"><a href="#1-The-Marcus-Test" class="headerlink" title="1. The Marcus Test"></a>1.

The test is simple—you judge an AI model based on its ability to watch and understand YouTube videos and TV shows without subtitles or text. For the AI to pass the Marcus test, it should understand sarcasm, humor, irony, and the storyline when watching the videos and explain it like a human.</p><p> At the moment,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-new-gpt4-features-explained/" >GPT-4 can describe images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but so far, there is currently no AI model that can comprehend videos like a human.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/self-driving-cars-explained/" >Self-driving vehicles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> come close, but they’re not completely autonomous and require sensors since they can’t make sense of everything in their surrounding environment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-The-Visual-Turing-Test"><a href="#2-The-Visual-Turing-Test" class="headerlink" title="2.

It works like the Turing test, but instead of answering questions using texts, participants are shown images and expected to answer simple questions while thinking like a human. However, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-captchas-work/" >visual Turing test is different from CAPTCHAs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since all the answers are correct—but to pass the test, the AI must process the images similarly to a human.</p><p> Beyond that, if an AI and a human are shown multiple images side by side and asked to identify realistic images, the human would have the cognitive ability to pass the test. This is because AI models find it difficult to distinguish images that don’t look like they were taken in the real world.

However, Alan Turing objected to that theory arguing that AI can still surprise humans. It wasn’t until 2001 that the guidelines for the Lovelace test were developed to tell apart an AI from a human—and, as per the<a class="link"   href="http://www.thekurzweillibrary.com/georgia-tech-professor-proposes-another-alternative-to-the-turing-test" >thekurzweillibrary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the rules were later revised in 2014.</p><p> For an AI to pass the Lovelace test, it must demonstrate that it can generate original ideas that exceed its training. Current AI models like GPT-4 don’t have the capability to come up with new inventions beyond our existing knowledge.

More succinctly, the AI classification framework is based on the theory of multiple intelligence, which requires human intelligence to satisfy at least eight different criteria, which include: musical-rhythm, logical-mathematical intelligence, visual identification, emotional intelligence, self-reflective intelligence, existential thinking ability, and body movement.</p><p> Since the AI is evaluated on eight different parameters, it’s unlikely to pass for a human even if it performs better than average in certain benchmarks.

This makes your Shorts video more entertaining and enriched with more elements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-AI-Portrait-1"><a href="#3-AI-Portrait-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You may want to add a bit of elements or filters. The AI Portrait feature automatically removes background with high accuracy to further enhance your videos. It also comes with over 70 portrait and sticker effects to bring out the mood you are going after. Automatically recognize the faces of your subjects and add AR stickers on the go.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>YouTube Shorts have become immensely popular. They tend to have a higher ROI and receive more engagement compared to long-form video content. This makes vertical short-form videos more important and lucrative for content creators. When it comes to YouTube short video monetization, posting quality videos is the key ingredient. We recommend using Wondershare FIlmora to edit your videos. This will make sure they are more entertaining and keep more people engaged.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p><h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p><p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p><p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p><p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul.jpg"                      alt="jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul"                ></p><p>Image resource: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42548207/logan-and-jake-paul-the-brothers-dominating-social-media" >BBC NEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p><p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p><h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p><p>![Jake Paul and Disney](<a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Jake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Paul disney-tubefilter.com.jpg)</p><p>Image resource:tubefilter.com</p><h3 id="Team-10"><a href="#Team-10" class="headerlink" title="Team 10"></a>Team 10</h3><p>In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled “You Gotta Want It.” As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched “<strong>Team 10</strong>,” his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p><p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-team-10.jpg.jpg"                      alt="Jake Paul and Team 10"                ></p><p>Image resource:venturebeat.com</p><p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p><p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p><p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire.

Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels.

Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format.

These are short, vertical videos that are 60 seconds long. Originally a way of YouTube attempting to compete with TikTok, Shorts have become a household name. However, are YouTube shorts monetized? Can you get paid for YouTube shorts? The increasing interest in monetizing Shorts has inspired many creators working on their video creation. This article answers the question of <strong>can YouTube Shorts be monetized</strong> and explains how the revenue-sharing model works.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Editor</strong> A cross-platform helps creators edit the vertical videos quickly and easily!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing"><a href="#Part-1-Unveiling-the-Mystery-of-YouTube-Shorts-Revenue-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing"></a><strong>Part 1. Unveiling the Mystery of YouTube Shorts Revenue Sharing</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched the Shorts platform in 2021, which gained popularity within a short period. By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties. This begged the question: can you get paid from YouTube shorts?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-shorts-revenue-sharing-explained-how-much-will-i-make-1.JPG"                      alt="youtube shorts"                ></p><p>Yes, YouTube updated its Partner Program, allowing the revenue-sharing model to benefit Shorts creators. The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized? Yes, the ads-sharing model defines the amount of money a creator can earn from Shorts every month. Depending on the number of views generated, high-performing Shorts can bring in a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Monetization-Eligibility-Criteria-and-Earnings-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. YouTube Shorts Monetization: Eligibility Criteria and Earnings Potential"></a><strong>Part 2. YouTube Shorts Monetization: Eligibility Criteria and Earnings Potential</strong></h2><p>YouTube Shorts provides creators with an exceptional way of making extra income.

By the end of the first year, some videos had racked up more than half a billion views and counties.

The platform pools all the money it gets from advertisers every month from the Shorts feeds. It then shares that money with creators based on the number of views. Since the launch of this program in February 2023, the previous YouTube Shorts Fund became defunct.</p><p>The ad revenue-sharing model on YouTube Shorts may seem complex, but let’s break it down</p><ul><li>Every month YouTube pools all the revenue it generates from ads that appear in the Shorts feed.</li><li>YouTube calculates that is going to the Creators Pool. A chuck of this money goes towards paying for songs used in YouTube Shorts. For instance, only a third of the ad revenue generated from a Shorts goes to the Creator Pool if it used two songs while the rest goes to paying for the music.</li><li>YouTube divides the Creator pool depending on the number of views they contributed. If a creator generated 5% of the Shorts views during a period, they are assigned 5% of the Creator Pool.</li><li>From that amount, YouTube keeps 55% of its share while you get paid the remaining 45%. If a creator’s 5% amounted to $800, then they will receive $360.</li></ul><p>So, is YouTube shorts monetized?

If your dream is to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it’s important to remember that regular people are doing it.</p><p>Jesse Ridgway is the owner of the vlog <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/McJuggerNuggets" >McJuggerNuggets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has grown to over 3.4 million subscribers. He makes enough money to live off of YouTube alone. Here is a case study of how he made his first $10,000 on YouTube:</p><h2 id="Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets"><a href="#Case-Study-of-McJuggerNuggets" class="headerlink" title="Case Study of McJuggerNuggets"></a>Case Study of McJuggerNuggets</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/case-study-mcjugger-nuggets.jpg"                      alt="Case Study McJugger Nuggets"                ></p><p>Jesse was one of the earliest YouTubers. He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense"><a href="#AdSense" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season.

He started his channel on December 9, 2006. Jesse never guessed that he would make enough money to live off of the videos he was creating. Here are some of the ways that he monetized his channel:</p><h4 id="AdSense-3"><a href="#AdSense-3" class="headerlink" title="AdSense"></a>AdSense</h4><p>Monetization of videos through AdSense is one of the easiest ways that you can start to profit off your videos. Registering for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/#?modal%5Factive=none" >Google AdSense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can earn you between $0.30 and $2.00 per thousand ad impressions (an impression is a click, not a view). How much you make per ad impression depends on a lot of things, including the time of year. There are good months for advertising revenue and bad months. December is usually the hottest month for making money through AdSense because of the holiday shopping season. Some of the other months where you can see huge profits include September for back-to-school, June, and March.</p><p>More popular channels get higher paying ads, and it is harder to earn ad revenue in popular vlogging genres (i.e. gaming) than in more obscure niches.</p><h4 id="Target-the-Right-Demographic-3"><a href="#Target-the-Right-Demographic-3" class="headerlink" title="Target the Right Demographic"></a>Target the Right Demographic</h4><p>Some of the largest YouTuber success stories are creators who primarily target younger audiences. Others target men or women specifically. Think about who you want your audience to be and make videos that will appeal to them.</p><h4 id="Multichannel-Networks-3"><a href="#Multichannel-Networks-3" class="headerlink" title="Multichannel Networks"></a>Multichannel Networks</h4><p>Once you hit a certain level of subscribership and views you will start getting invited to MCMs. In some cases, multichannel network promotions could entitle you to discounts on merchandise and products. Be careful: a multichannel network will always want you to sign a contract, and they will take over your AdSense account.</p><h4 id="Social-Blade-3"><a href="#Social-Blade-3" class="headerlink" title="Social Blade"></a>Social Blade</h4><p>This site will provide details about your subscription count, which of your videos has the best watch time, and more.

There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean?

Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p><p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p><p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p><p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p><p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p><p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p><p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p><p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube"><a href="#Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube"></a><strong>Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube</strong></h4><ol><li>View the video that contains your copyrighted material.</li><li>Click on “Report”</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-copyright-infringement-youtube.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Select “Infringes my rights” in the pop up window and click “infringes my copyright” in the dropdown options.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infringe-my-copyright-report.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Supply additional information to the report form, including the URL of the video infringing your copyrighted content and the URL of your own video.</li><li>Submit report and wait for an email confirmation that the infringing content has been removed.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created.

That’s all you want to know.</p><p>In this article, we are going to address the key areas that YouTubers need to understand when it comes to YouTube copyright. What is okay and what isn’t? What may be considered risky or what would be worth taking a chance?</p><p>Remember that everything discussed in this article is only best practices and shouldn’t be taken as definitive legal advice.</p><p>Now that we are set, let’s dive in:</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Fair Use?"></a>Part 1: What is Fair Use?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube copyright, we have to talk about fair use.</p><p>Without fair use, there wouldn’t be any flexibility for creators. There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-1"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p><p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-1"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p><p>This may have surprised you.

That’s all you want to know.</p><p>In this article, we are going to address the key areas that YouTubers need to understand when it comes to YouTube copyright. What is okay and what isn’t? What may be considered risky or what would be worth taking a chance?</p><p>Remember that everything discussed in this article is only best practices and shouldn’t be taken as definitive legal advice.</p><p>Now that we are set, let’s dive in:</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Fair Use?"></a>Part 1: What is Fair Use?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube copyright, we have to talk about fair use.</p><p>Without fair use, there wouldn’t be any flexibility for creators. There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-2"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p><p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-2"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p><p>This may have surprised you.

Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p><p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p><p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p><p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p><p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p><p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p><p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-2"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p><p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube-2"><a href="#Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube"></a><strong>Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube</strong></h4><ol><li>View the video that contains your copyrighted material.</li><li>Click on “Report”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-copyright-infringement-youtube.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Select “Infringes my rights” in the pop up window and click “infringes my copyright” in the dropdown options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infringe-my-copyright-report.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Supply additional information to the report form, including the URL of the video infringing your copyrighted content and the URL of your own video.</li><li>Submit report and wait for an email confirmation that the infringing content has been removed.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match-2"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created.

There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p><p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p><ol><li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li><li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li><li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-3"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p><p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p><p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p><p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p><p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p><p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-3"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p><p>This may have surprised you.

Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p><p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p><p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p><p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p><p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p><p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p><p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-3"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p><p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p><h4 id="Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Report-Copyright-Infringements-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube"></a><strong>Steps to Report Copyright Infringements on YouTube</strong></h4><ol><li>View the video that contains your copyrighted material.</li><li>Click on “Report”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/report-copyright-infringement-youtube.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Select “Infringes my rights” in the pop up window and click “infringes my copyright” in the dropdown options.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infringe-my-copyright-report.jpg"                      alt="report copyright infringement"                ></p><ol><li>Supply additional information to the report form, including the URL of the video infringing your copyrighted content and the URL of your own video.</li><li>Submit report and wait for an email confirmation that the infringing content has been removed.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match-3"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos-1"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Instead of having your main light off to one side set it up directly in front of you so your entire face is lit evenly. It is still a good idea to use fill lights in this set up to give you some dimension, and a backlight is even more essential for helping you stand out from the background.

Viewers find poor lighting distracting and it’s hard for them to see how great your content is if they are busy thinking about why your video is so dark. By creating a great lighting set up you can ensure that the people watching your videos are only thinking about how much they’re enjoying them.</p><p>Going outside and using natural light is the cheapest way to get a lot of light for your videos. If your vlog is not suited to the great outdoors then you need to get more strategic. You can turn on all the lights in your living room and still end up with a dark, grainy, video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting-3"><a href="#Video-Lighting-Basics-Three-Point-Lighting-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting"></a>Video Lighting Basics: Three Point Lighting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-point-lighting.jpg"                      alt=" Lighting for YouTube Video"                ></p><p>The most common technique of lighting a scene is called <strong>three-point lighting</strong>. It involves three different sources of light in the shot and is used by portrait photographers, which is also a great method for lighting your vlog.</p><p>The brightest source of light is also known as the <strong>key light</strong> which need to be high quality. A window will work, but if you do not have access to one where you are filming then consider an LED panel light or a softbox light like the ones used in portrait photography.</p><p>This first light will create a dramatic shadow across half of your face. You want to reduce this shadow, but not get rid of it completely.</p><p>Rather than setting up another light source on the opposite side of the camera, put up a reflector to bounce some light back onto your face. This reflector is called your <strong>‘Fill Light’</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fill light</strong> is less bright than the primary source of light and it is placed on the side opposite to the key light. Its purpose is to reduce shadows produced by the key light and the reflector will need to be mounted on a stand.</p><p>The final step to creating three point lighting is to set up another light behind you. This is your ‘Backlight’, and it will help you stand out from your background. <strong>Backlight or Hair light</strong> is always placed behind and above the subject to create separation between the subject in the shot and the background. This basic lighting technique can be applied in almost every scene you shoot, which is why it is important to keep an open mind and to continue experimenting with possible light setups.</p><h3 id="Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-3"><a href="#Watch-Video-Top-Lighting-Tips-for-Vlogging-3" class="headerlink" title="Watch Video!

Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some.

If your YouTube videos get flagged for copyright issues relating to the background music or film clips it can be frustrating, especially if you receive a copyright notice for using royalty-free music you have a license for. Rather than feeling as though your creativity is being restrained, read this article to better understand the reasons copyright issues come up and what can be done to resolve them. Disputing copyright claims is something that any YouTuber can do.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One-3"><a href="#Part-1：-What-is-a-Content-ID-Claim-and-Why-Have-I-Received-One-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?"></a>Part 1： What is a Content ID Claim and Why Have I Received One?</h2><p>YouTube copyright issues often come up as a result of content ID claims. This will prompt Google support to deliver a copyright notice to your account. Content ID claims are generally made against content that contains material that should not be available on YouTube. Claims are often issued if you don’t own the music, movie clips, TV clips, express rights to showcase cut scenes in video games, or other copyrighted media.</p><p>If you happen to see that a video has been muted or taken down you can visit the copyright notices section of your video manager to learn more. In this section you will learn more about what will be done as a result of the content ID claim.</p><p>Generally, a content ID claim does not put a YouTube channel in any kind of trouble. What usually happens is that the video is removed, you lose the ability to earn ad revenue from it, or the sound is muted so the copyrighted music no longer plays.</p><p>In some cases, the owner of the copyrighted content (usually musical artists) may choose to allow you to keep your video up in exchange for running their ads.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-Dealing-With-a-Copyright-Claim-on-Your-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 2: Dealing With a Copyright Claim on Your YouTube Video</h2><p>If you have received copyright claims there are ways that you can get your content put back up in its original condition.</p><p>First, you could purchase the rights to use the copyrighted media after your video has been flagged or try getting express permission from the content creator to use aspects of their content in your own original video.</p><p>Sometimes, your videos may be flagged even though you’ve already purchased the license for the copyrighted music, images or clips you are using.</p><p>YouTube’s robots automatically scan through the database of audio and visual content that is put up by copyright owners. Any video that has been uploaded to YouTube with this copyrighted content will receive a third-party copyright notice. Because flagging happens automatically it often affects creators who have licenses for the royalty-free music, or other copyrighted material, they are using.</p><p>The good news is that this same level of protection will ensure that your own original content can also be protected from reuse if you register it.</p><p>In order to dispute a copyright claim on your video the first thing that you will need is some proof that you have purchased the rights to the music or other content that is being reused in your video. If you have a direct link to the online license agreement this can help with the dispute process. Purchasing a license online for royalty-free music or other content is usually fairly simple and with a PDF license certificate you can quickly dispute copyright content ID claims.</p><p>You can upload your license document to the file sharing system Dropbox to make the content public for YouTube admins to check over. Heading over to your video manager on YouTube and sending a message link with the dispute and link to your license will make sure that your explanation is heard. Sending the license, written permission, or a link to the legal license will result in YouTube reinstating your video.</p><p>Most of the time the only information that you need to use is where the license was purchased as well as the link to where the copyright license document can be accessed.</p><p>After submitting your dispute YouTube admins will often take a few business days to get back to you with an answer. There is no risk involved in disputing a copyright claim; your video has already been flagged. In the worst case scenario, your video will remain flagged.</p><p>Usually with the help of an official license or direct permission from the content creator you can file a dispute with YouTube and receive an answer. If the dispute process is successful your video will be reinstated to the original uploaded version without blocked sound or content.</p><p><a class="link"

Now that YouTube has rolled out the plan for YouTube Shorts monetization, we can anticipate more YouTube Shorts monetization in the future. You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf. YouTube then suggests these clips to others with similar interests (depending on the keywords that you have added in the description). When such users watch your short videos, the chances are that they would subscribe to your YouTube channel and watch the regular videos that you have already posted, thus helping you make money using any of the methods listed above.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this approach is, the number of views your short videos affects the overall analytics of your YouTube channel (in terms of view count and playback duration), and therefore play a vital role in meeting the minimum requirements as per YouTube policies to get your other, regular YouTube clips monetized.</p><h2 id="Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Why-did-People-See-Less-Revenue-Than-Regular-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?"></a>Why did People See Less Revenue Than Regular YouTube Video?</h2><p>When you start publishing short videos on your YouTube channel, the views that those clips get also affect the total view count and the playback duration of your channel. Although this helps you reach the minimum threshold for the monetization services that the platform offers, because the short videos cannot be monetized, you may see some depreciation in the revenue generation over time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Because YouTube Shorts is still in the Beta phase at the time of this writing, the short videos don’t directly contribute to the monetization process. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, every time your short clips are viewed, your channel’s analytics are affected as per the view count and the playback time.</p><p>Furthermore, with interesting short videos, your channel is likely to get more subscribers, thus resulting in meeting the minimum threshold to becoming eligible and applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program.</p><p>Regardless of the fact that the revenue may seem deteriorated in contrast with the number of views and play time of the videos, the increment in the number of subscribers and paid members (if your channel allows them) would significantly appreciate your income.</p><p>And the most optimistic part is, Google is still working on and exploring YouTube Shorts.

Most creators on FameBit charge between $0.05 and $0.10 per view. If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience. If you often mention products you like in videos and your subscribers have come to trust your recommendations, then it makes sense for you to charge more per view than a creator whose audience will be less receptive to product placement.</p><p>For example, if you do makeup tutorials then viewers will be used to hearing about your favorites. This makes your 10 000 views more valuable than 10 000 views on a ranting vlog channel whose subscribers are not tuning in to hear about products.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money With FameBit"></a>How to Make Money With FameBit</h2><h4 id="Finding-Sponsorships"><a href="#Finding-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Finding Sponsorships"></a>Finding Sponsorships</h4><p>Brands post details about their upcoming campaigns, and the types of creators they are interested in working with, on FameBit.</p><p>While you are browsing through the available campaigns, think of the types of brands you would be excited to work with as well as which ones make sense for your channel.</p><p>If you host a lifestyle vlog about staying healthy, for example, and there is an opportunity to work with a brand that sells a type of healthy snack then it is your responsibility to look into the company and the product before you sign on to work with them. Is the snack healthy, and do you enjoy it?</p><p>Ideally, you will want to find brands that share your values and which are selling products you feel good about recommending to your subscribers.</p><p>Once you find a few campaigns you are interested in creating videos for, it’s time to write your proposals and negotiate with your potential sponsors.</p><h4 id="Negotiating-with-Sponsors"><a href="#Negotiating-with-Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Negotiating with Sponsors"></a>Negotiating with Sponsors</h4><p>When you want to be part of a campaign a brand has posted, you send them a proposal.</p><p>Be creative and detailed in the proposals you write. The best brands will value you for our ideas and creativity, and this will give you an edge over creators who put less effort into their pitches. You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be subtle, but you never want to hide that it is there.</p><p>So long as you are honest and the more commercial elements of your video are not distracting, the vast majority of your subscribers – the ones you have built a real relationship with – will not mind.</p><h2 id="Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor"><a href="#Custom-Videos-with-Awesome-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Custom Videos with Awesome Video Editor"></a>Custom Videos with Awesome Video Editor</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >FameBit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the leading influencer marketing platforms.</p><p>Creators use FameBit to earn money by creating branded content.

You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be subtle, but you never want to hide that it is there.</p><p>So long as you are honest and the more commercial elements of your video are not distracting, the vast majority of your subscribers – the ones you have built a real relationship with – will not mind.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

To do that we have to apply Human Segmentation to the footage first. It will separate the human from the footage. Drag and drop the Human Segmentation effect into the footage in the timeline. Once you drop it into the footage, it will ask you to purchase this feature to export the footage. Since we are not trying to export the footage, we are only creating a thumbnail, click on “Try It”. Once the background is removed, you can add other effects as well. Drag and drop the “Human Border” into the footage. It creates an outline around the human in your footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-portrait-thumbnail-step9.png"                      alt="ai-portrait-thumbnail-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> The effect will be applied to the footage.
