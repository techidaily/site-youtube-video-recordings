A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).</p><h2 id="A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers"><a href="#A-More-Effective-Way-of-Asking-For-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers"></a>A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers</h2><p>Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out. Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:</p><h4 id="Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer"><a href="#Step-1-How-to-Hook-The-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer"></a>Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer</h4><p>As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers’ mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly"><a href="#Step-2-Get-to-The-Point-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly"></a>Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly</h4><p>Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Create-A-Moment-Make-Subscribing-Part-of-the-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience"></a>Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience</h4><p>It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg"                      alt=" how to ask people to subscribe"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151872/7443" target="_top" id="2151872">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151872" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151872/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality.

Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows?

A free streaming video downloader is here to laugh you out in a dull long journey when there’s no Wi-Fi nor Internet.</p><p><em>[<strong>Copyright Warning:</strong> You shall not use the copywritten content for any commercial purpose!]</em></p><p><strong>[Warning] YouTube music &amp; copyright-protected contents are not supported for download.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Streaming-Video-Downloader-VS-Download-Website-VS-Video-Recorder"><a href="#Streaming-Video-Downloader-VS-Download-Website-VS-Video-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Video Downloader VS Download Website VS Video Recorder"></a>Streaming Video Downloader VS Download Website VS Video Recorder</h2><p>The above three method all find you a way to download the video streams even when the network creeps. An independent streaming video downloader, boosting nice downloading speed and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >flexible output format choice of MKV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, MP4 and more, guarantees higher level of stability and safety than the lightweight browser-based video download websites. While the multipurpose streaming video recorder which can handle even the unrecognizable URL and a bunch more video downloading functions, goes at a little cost but outshines in sleek performance.</p><p>Most commonly used method to download streaming videos include:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >streaming video downloader -&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >video download websites -&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >video recording software -&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br> The first two, as name indicate, save the video stream directly as a file while the video recorder can record your entire screen, assuredly any images or video stream you can see. Specified below are the differences among them regarding video output format, compatibility to video streaming websites, customization choice of video recording area and add-on functions of this free streaming video downloader.</p><p><strong>How to Download Streaming Video with 3rd Party Streaming Video Downloader Software?</strong> </p><p>- Compared to the browser-based video download websites like Keepvid or <a class="link"   href="https://lentrepreneurenvous.com/logiciel-enregistrement-ecran/" >the video recording software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, indepedent streaming video downloaders prove to be the most preferred choice featuring reliable performance and enclosed recording zone available. Often such 3rd party downloaders charges from $5.99 to above $30, while we discovered a newborn freeware -<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/" >5KPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to run at excellent downloading speed and to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >download 4K&#x2F;5K&#x2F;8K UHD videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> up to 73 output format available, it’s built-in downloading kernel proves to be as robust as paid commercial video downloaders, fully tested by its utility in downloading 8K videos. In contrast, quite a number of software supports MP4 only as the streaming video downloading format.<br> - Another reason that matters for using independent streaming video downloader software is that, when working on other programs like Photoshop or Office, this streaming video recorder proceeds the downloading in background. So when your work gets done, the video stream also gets saved for offline viewing just fine.</p><p><strong>How to Download Streaming Video with Browser-Based Downloading Websites?</strong></p><p>Browser-based video downloading websites like Keepvid allow users to provide them with streaming video URLs, after the analyzing it provides a list of video streaming resource to choose and download from. This method features its lightweight advantage, not taking one more byte on your system disc, but also aroused user feedbacks like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >is Keepvid safe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Moreover, you have to sacrifice the video stream downloading speed, that the recording speed is throttled for other webpages you opened would share bandwidth, unlike an independent streaming video downloader that works confined only to your maximal broadband speed.</p><p><strong>How to Record Streaming Video on YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix and more?</strong></p><p>The ultimate solution of streaming video downloading and recording. There’s just nothing that a Video Converter Pro for Mac or Windows can’t do.<br> - It surpasses the above method of analyzing and downloading the streaming videos, which is somewhat like extracting a streaming video file, instead it <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/" >records your computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at OS level, also enabling you to enclose a cetain video streaming playback area to record.<br> Now compared to the independent video streaming downloader 5KPlayer, the Video Converter Pro features powerful conversion functions in regard of streaming video formats, turning the html 4&#x2F;5 YouTube video you just downloaded into the format that plays on iPhone&#x2F;iPad, Android devices, Surface Pro 3 and more, while you have to keep the recording windows at top, unlike 5KPlayer which continues streaming video downloading whilst your doing Photoshops.</p><p><img

This is because more and more people choose to watch videos than any other form of video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-ad-creator.jpg"                      alt="youtube ad creator"                ></p><p>But to make sure that you are putting your best foot forward when it comes to video ads, you need to invest in a YouTube ad creator that is easy to use and effective. Here, we will be looking at the best YouTube video creators that you can use.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-YouTube-Video-Ads"><a href="#Why-Use-YouTube-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why Use YouTube Video Ads"></a>Why Use YouTube Video Ads</h2><p>Before we look at some of the tools you can use to create YouTube video ads, it is important to mention some of the reasons why you may want to choose YouTube ads over other solutions. YouTube ads when compared to PPC are relatively cheaper and you also choose how much you are willing to pay when a user clicks on the ads. This makes it unlikely that you could spend more than you intended to.</p><p>YouTube ads are also more targeted than any other form of advertising. You have a lot of options when choosing who you want to target including metrics such as demographics, topics, similar audiences, customer matches, life events, and more.</p><p>Since the ad is a video, it generates far more engagement than a text ad on any other platform. Even though it is an ad, the video is still a great way for your brand to connect with potential audiences.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Video-Ads-for-YouTube"><a href="#Types-of-Video-Ads-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Types of Video Ads for YouTube"></a>Types of Video Ads for YouTube</h2><p>The following are the different types of YouTube ads that you can create;</p><p>**<strong>Video Discovery</strong></p><p>Video discover ads appear on the search page results and are usually composed of a thumbnail image and a few lines of text. They also have a very recognizable “Ad” in the box to let all users know that this is sponsored content.</p><p>**<strong>In-Stream Ads</strong></p><p>In-stream video ads can be skippable or non-skippable. Skippable in-stream video ads will often play for a minimum of 5 seconds before allowing the user to skip to the video content. Non-skippable in-stream video ads do not have the “skip” button and the user has to watch the video to the end.</p><p>**<strong>Pre-roll Ads</strong></p><p>A pre-roll ad is just an in-stream ad that is not skippable. It doesn’t give the user the option of skipping the app and they have to watch the entire ad before they can watch the video. The pre-roll video ad is usually 15 to 60 seconds long.</p><p>**<strong>Bumper Ads</strong></p><p>Bumper ads are tiny non-skippable 6-second ads that will play right before the video content loads. They can be an ideal way to promote an event or a new brand. Since they are only 6 seconds long, they can be very easy to make.</p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Ad-Creators"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Ad-Creators" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Ad Creators"></a>Best YouTube Ad Creators</h2><p>The following are the best YouTube ad creators that you can use to make your YouTube video ad;</p><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Best For: All Types of YouTube Video ads</p><p>Price: Free Trial Available with plans starting from $54.99 a year.</p><p>Rating: 4.8&#x2F;5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/adjust-border-pip-video.jpg"                      alt="filmora ad video maker"                ></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the best video creation software in the market and therefore can be very useful when creating YouTube video ads of any kind.

In that case, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/" >5KPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the right MKV downloader and player to solve the problem at one time!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/" >How to Play MKV with VLC Media Player? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There is a large quantity of video streaming sites upload videos to chrome in MKV only, which leaves no choice but to download MKV movies and videos for the people who like to save those movies and share. You will find that MKV indeed embraces a lot of amazing features like variable frame rate, selectable&#x2F;subtitle&#x2F;audio&#x2F;video streams, error resilience and full metadata supports.</p><p>However, such an open standard free container is not so compatible with some standard media player. For example, VLC is one of the most welcomed <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/" >free MKV players <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which claim having zero drawbacks, but how to explain <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/" >VLC not working <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sometimes and the problem of <strong>VLC audio delay</strong> while playing MKV video. There are a lot of normal standard HD media players that also support playing MKV but only with the help of codec attached. The sad thing is that some people don’t prefer to use codec pack because, while simple to install, they can interfere with your existing set up and causing other problems. If downloading a free MKV video player that supports MKV downloading and playing MKV can simply do the trick, what else would you need?</p><p><strong>5KPlayer – Best Free MKV Downloader and Player</strong></p><p>5KPlayer is a powerful yet easy to use free MKV downloader and player for both Mac and PC that not only downloads MKV movies, MKV TV shows, MKV music videos fast and free but also plays MKV videos all alone without a slightly glitch.

For example, “vlog.” Hit Search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag generator"                ></p><p>Then, select the Hashtags panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg"                      alt="youtube hashtag tool"                ></p><p>This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="list of tags for youtube"                ></p><p>That’s all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.</p><h3 id="2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension-1"><a href="#2-TubeBuddy-Chrome-Extension-1" class="headerlink" title="2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension"></a>2 <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy Chrome Extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg"                      alt="tubebuddy chrome extension"                ></p><p>TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags.

All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-dailymotion-video.jpg"                      alt="Sync Dailymotion video"                ></p><p>It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video.

Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site’s reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.</p><p>The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.</p><p>The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks.

Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.</p><p>Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.</p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important-3"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Backlinks-Important-3" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Backlinks Important?"></a>Are YouTube Backlinks Important?</h2><p>Yes.

But with no experience or training, it’s hard to know how to start a vlog and make money.</p><p>Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!</p><p>This course shows you how to launch a profitable YouTube channel and monetize your new channel. You’ll learn everything you need to know, from finding your niche and the best ways to promote your vlog. Once your vlog starts getting views, you’ll see how to turn your viewers into subscribers, make money, and become a YouTube sensation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-1.jpg"                      alt="start vlog and make money"                ></p><p><strong>Background of vlogs on YouTube</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-2.jpg"                      alt="background of vlogs on youtube"                ></p><p>What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.</p><p><strong>Why vlogs are loved by people</strong></p><p>Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.</p><p>But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">YouTube Ads</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-4">Patreon</a></li><li><a href="#part3-5">Sell your service or products</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Top 10 Highest-Paid Vloggers on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-Make-Money-Through-My-Vlog" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?</h2><p>So you’ve started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren’t you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let’s look at some common reasons why vloggers aren’t making any income and figure out how to get around them.</p><h3 id="Who-is-my-target-audience"><a href="#Who-is-my-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Who is my target audience?"></a>Who is my target audience?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg"                      alt="target audience"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>So, let’s be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they’re not making money because they haven’t figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren’t making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they’re trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.</p><h3 id="What-problems-am-I-solving"><a href="#What-problems-am-I-solving" class="headerlink" title="What problems am I solving?"></a>What problems am I solving?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-4.jpg"                      alt="problem solving"                ></p><p>It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren’t making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.</p><h3 id="What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience"><a href="#What-solutions-am-I-offering-Are-these-solutions-both-financially-viable-for-you-and-in-line-with-the-needs-of-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="What solutions am I offering?

Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?</h3><p>The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you’re addressing the target audience’s needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Start-a-Profitable-Vlog-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel</h2><p>It’s easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.</p><h3 id="Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find"><a href="#Find-your-niche-what-is-a-niche-and-how-to-find" class="headerlink" title="Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)"></a>Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)</h3><p>A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you’re passionate about and what you’re good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you’re offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.</p><h3 id="Consistency-and-patience"><a href="#Consistency-and-patience" class="headerlink" title="Consistency and patience"></a>Consistency and patience</h3><p>Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people’s interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube’s algorithm.</p><h3 id="Content-quality"><a href="#Content-quality" class="headerlink" title="Content quality"></a>Content quality</h3><p>With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it’s clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube’s algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you’re looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you’ll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.</p><p>And to do that, you must try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editing software.

This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn’t. There are so many ways to make money vlogging, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. Let’s break down the main ways to make money vlogging into different categories.</p><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg"                      alt="youtube advertising"                ></p><p>Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don’t let a video with few views make you think you can’t make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.</p><p>According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser’s actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorship"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorship"></a>Brand Sponsorship</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg"                      alt="sponsorship"                ></p><p>While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.</p><p>Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-8.jpg"                      alt="youtube affiliate marketing"                ></p><p>Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it’s through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Patreon"><a href="#Patreon" class="headerlink" title="Patreon"></a>Patreon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-9.jpg"                      alt="support on patreon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Patreon is another option, and if done correctly, it can turn a niche blog into a revenue source, which is great for bloggers and vloggers alike. By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.</p><h3 id="Sell-your-service-or-products"><a href="#Sell-your-service-or-products" class="headerlink" title="Sell your service or products"></a>Sell your service or products</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-10.jpg"                      alt="sell products or services"                ></p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users, there’s an opportunity for content creators to make money by selling their products or services. You could sell your physical products to your audience as a vlogger. The best method this can be done is by creating an online store that sells T-shirts and mugs with your branding. Make sure those products must be related to your niche or channel category.

This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won’t be able to customize your playlist.</p><p>Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.</p><p>To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.</p><p>Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.</p><p>Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click <strong>“Update”</strong> to save the changes.</p><p>WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.</p><h3 id="Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing"><a href="#Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing" class="headerlink" title="Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing "></a>Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe ></h3><p>Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your <strong>YouTube channel.</strong></p><p>Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon, and a pop-up window will appear.</p><p>Step3 Choose the <strong>“Embed”</strong> option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist’s embed code.
