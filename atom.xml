You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.</p><p>The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here.

Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.</p><p>There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.</p><p>If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.</p><p>Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube.

There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-4"><a href="#YouTube-Alternatives-3-Best-Video-Sharing-Sites-4" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites"></a>YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites</h2><p>Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:</p><h4 id="1-Dailymotion-3"><a href="#1-Dailymotion-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Dailymotion"></a>1. Dailymotion</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG"                      alt="YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion"                ></p><p>This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.</p><p>The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.</p><h4 id="2-Vimeo-3"><a href="#2-Vimeo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Vimeo"></a>2. Vimeo</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG"                      alt="YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo"                ></p><p>Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.</p><p>There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.</p><p>If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.</p><p>Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.</p><h4 id="3-ZippCast-3"><a href="#3-ZippCast-3" class="headerlink" title="3. ZippCast"></a>3.

While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.</p><p>One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.</p><p>Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Why-YouTube-TV-Is-a-Game-Changer-in-Streaming"><a href="#Why-YouTube-TV-Is-a-Game-Changer-in-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Why YouTube TV Is a Game-Changer in Streaming"></a>Why YouTube TV Is a Game-Changer in Streaming</h2><h5 id="Create-High-Quality-Video-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-Video-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality Video - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality Video - Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy and powerful YouTube video editor</p><p>Numerous video and audio effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>YouTube TV has a distinctive set of features that make it incredibly enticing — so much so that it is comfortably among the top three live TV providers in the United States in terms of paid subscribers.

This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.</p><p>In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable.

It’s an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.</p><p>When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.</p><p>Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you’ll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-1.jpg"                      alt="youtube tv"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV-3"><a href="#How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Watch YouTube TV?"></a>How to Watch YouTube TV?</h2><h4 id="Using-a-computer-3"><a href="#Using-a-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="Using a computer"></a>Using a computer</h4><ol><li>Ensure that your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as Chromecast.</li><li>Open your favorite browser and navigate to tv.youtube.com.</li><li>Choose the show or movie that you wish to watch.</li><li>When the video has loaded, click the Cast icon.

But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel’s YouTube Studio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG"                      alt="opening youtube studio on computer"                ></p><ul><li>On the left navigation menu, click “Content.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG"                      alt="content section on youtube studio"                ></p><ul><li>Click the “pencil” icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.</li><li>Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click “Create Thumbnail.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-5.JPG"                      alt="changing shorts thumbnail on youtube studio"                ></p><h2 id="Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing"><a href="#Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148646/16836" target="_top" id="2148646">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148646" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148646/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG"                      alt="fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Convert MKV to MP4 without Losing Quality [Free Converters Provided] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896505/19272" target="_top" id="1896505">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896505" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896505/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro"></a>Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV?

Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do" class="headerlink" title="2. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?"></a>2. I want people to comment on my Private video. What should I do?</h4><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to post a comment on any video that has been set as ‘Private’. If your video is configured that way, you must change its nature to ‘Unlisted’, and share its link to the users before they can post a comment.</p><h4 id="3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments"><a href="#3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments" class="headerlink" title="3.

How can I block certain words and links on the YouTube comments?</h4><p>You can go to <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Community</strong>, and on the <strong>Automated Filters</strong> tab in the right window, add the words to block in the <strong>Blocked words</strong> field. You can add multiple words by separating them with commas. To block the comments with links, check the <strong>Block links</strong> box. Click <strong>SAVE</strong> to save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-users-youtube-comment.jpg"                      alt="Block YouTube   commnets"                ></p><h4 id="4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back"><a href="#4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back" class="headerlink" title="4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?"></a>4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?</h4><p>Yes. When you turn off the comments, the existing comments disappear. When you turn them back on, all the previous comments reappear, and become visible to the audience.</p><h4 id="5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted"><a href="#5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted" class="headerlink" title="5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?"></a>5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>.

They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop.

Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done.

How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video. Also, adding effects and filters on the video using an editor like Wondershare Filmora can help.</p><p>Users can subscribe to Shorts channels. And if they see that your videos are well-edited and high-quality, they’ll be more likely to do so. Once they are subscribed, they will see and watch your videos more often.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-break-through-bot-barriers-rising-from-the-crowd/"><u>[Updated] Break Through Bot Barriers Rising From the Crowd</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-flashback-filmmaking-top-tricks-from-80s-vhs-to-enhance-todays-edits/"><u>[Updated] Flashback Filmmaking Top Tricks From 80S VHS to Enhance Today’s Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-gpu-renaissance-amd-radeon-redux/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, GPU Renaissance AMD Radeon Redux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/daytime-delights-the-most-inspiring-anime-streaming-channels/"><u>Daytime Delights The Most Inspiring Anime Streaming Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/digital-dynamo-dames-the-next-generation-of-youtubes-powerhouses/"><u>Digital Dynamo Dames The Next Generation of YouTube's Powerhouses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fake-the-location-to-get-around-the-mlb-blackouts-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-6s-plus-passcode-screen-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6s Plus Passcode Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-efface-thin-borders-for-a-seamless-youtube-experience/"><u>In 2024, Efface Thin Borders for a Seamless YouTube Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-flight-tech-best-drone-gimbals/"><u>In 2024, Top Flight Tech Best Drone Gimbals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/mastering-the-preview-process-of-your-website-content-before-upload/"><u>Mastering the Preview Process of Your Website Content Before Upload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/musical-mentorship-series-top-15-youtube-wisdom-from-pros/"><u>Musical Mentorship Series - Top 15 YouTube Wisdom From Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/proven-ways-in-how-to-hide-location-on-life360-for-xiaomi-redmi-note-12t-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Proven Ways in How To Hide Location on Life360 For Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/radiant-faces-mastering-makeup-and-lighting-together/"><u>Radiant Faces Mastering Makeup and Lighting Together</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/studio-strategies-for-video-impact-and-growth/"><u>Studio Strategies for Video Impact and Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-how-to-bypass-swipe-screen-to-unlock-on-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide How to Bypass Swipe Screen to Unlock on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/winning-against-steam-lag-and-freeze-errors-in-202cdigital-marketing-agency/"><u>Winning Against Steam Lag and Freeze Errors in 202CDigital Marketing Agency</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The problem may not lie in the software. H265 decoding and playback requires a lot horsepower of your computer. So this time, you have two choices: elevate your computer specs, or compromise to current hardware and <strong>convert h265 to h264</strong>. 5KPlayer will assist you with the latter choice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027181/19272" target="_top" id="2027181">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027181" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027181/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Do-We-Need-to-Convert-H-265-to-H-264"><a href="#Why-Do-We-Need-to-Convert-H-265-to-H-264" class="headerlink" title="Why Do We Need to Convert H.265 to H.264?"></a>Why Do We Need to Convert H.265 to H.264?</h2><p><strong>For Streaming H265 4K Videos: Limited Bandwidth</strong> </p><p>The average bandwidth of America is only 10 Mbps reported in 2014. But h265 files requires at least 15Mbps, which is widely unrealizable. The largest streaming company Netflix is dedicated at achieving <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/" >4K streaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they can’t reliably deliver 15Mbps video over one of the fastest connections around. Even if the TV sets were out there, even if the content was out there, can you deliver 15Mbps video to these UHD sets? The answer is unless you’ve got your own pipes, probably not. Convert h265 to h264 in this regard, is quite practical for most viewers since uploading or online streaming h265 videos are beyond years to come. </p><p><strong>For playing h265 4K videos: Under Qualified Computer Specs;</strong></p><p>Even if you’ve got top-notch software like VLC for h265 decoding, unless you have got a robust hardware support to decode h265, you should let go the thought of playback h265 video smoothly without glitches. </p><p>Compare H.265 to h264, we can see that H.265 is way more processor intensive, don’t expect a simple firmware upgrade to get your gear to decode it. You’ll need intel i7 core processor, a GPU above $200, a RAM at minimum of 8G-32G plus a SSD. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135413/19272" target="_top" id="2135413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135413/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Do-You-Need-for-H-265-to-H-264-Conversion"><a href="#What-Do-You-Need-for-H-265-to-H-264-Conversion" class="headerlink" title="What Do You Need for H.265 to H.264 Conversion?"></a>What Do You Need for H.265 to H.264 Conversion?</h2><p>5Kplayer is what we suggest here.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-2"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-2"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-2" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production.

Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

It is welcomed to share on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talking-heads-youtube-video-shots-set-up.jpg"                      alt=" Setting up Talking Heads Video Shots for YouTube"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways-2"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Your-Talking-Head-Shots-for-YouTube-4-Ways-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]"></a>How to Set Up Your Talking-Head Shots for YouTube [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up-2"><a href="#1-Close-Quarters-Wide-Angle-Vlog-Set-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-2"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up-2"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up-2"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

You should also keep an eye on the length and file size limits. The more basic things you need to consider carefully when you upload are the title, description, and tags of your video. These are part of what determines if and where your video comes up in people’s search results. There are also slightly more advanced video specs, like your video’s resolution, which will be helpful for you to understand as somebody who will be producing video content frequently. These sorts of specs will affect how long it takes your videos to upload and how much of the quality they maintain.</p><h4 id="1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be"><a href="#1-How-Long-Can-my-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="1.

Other Basics"></a>3.  Other Basics</h4><p>After you click the ‘upload’ button on YouTube you are taken to a page where you choose a category for your video and add a title, description, and tags. These are all important for getting hits so you should put some thought into them.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Keep your title under 70 characters so none of it disappears into a ‘…’. The best titles make people curious or elicit an emotional response. Terms like ‘video’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ are often typed into people’s searches so if they apply to your video it can help to put them in the title.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> A short synopsis of your video which includes your most important keyword. You have about three lines before your text is hidden by a ‘show more’ tab. If you are including the URL of your channel or other videos then you should make sure they are above the ‘show more’.</p><p> <strong>Tags:</strong> Use a lot of them. These are the keywords and terms people will be searching for when they find your video. YouTube will suggest some after you start adding. A quick way to find good keywords to use is to search for videos similar to yours and check out their tags. A while ago YouTube started hiding video tags by default but you can download a free, YouTube-certified, extension for Google Chrome which will allow you to see them from vidIQ.com.</p><h4 id="4-Digging-Deeper"><a href="#4-Digging-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="4.  Digging Deeper"></a>4.  Digging Deeper</h4><p>To get your viewers to subscribe to your channel you will need to make sure your videos are not losing quality when you upload them. Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

The <strong>sign-in</strong> button is located at the top right corner of the YouTube homepage. If you have multiple accounts registered to one device, you will be asked to choose one to log in to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-signin.jpg"                      alt="sign in YouTube account"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button"><a href="#Step-2-Hit-the-upload-button" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Hit the upload button"></a>Step 2: Hit the upload button</h4><p>It is a simple step that you will have to follow right after you log in to YouTube. As soon as you enter YouTube, after using your Google account and password for login, you will find the upload button in the top right corner of the screen.

You can still share a private video with a limited number of people (as long as they have Google accounts).</p><p>The <strong>“Scheduled”</strong> option is available for choosing a future date and time to make the video available to viewers. Once you have selected your privacy level, simply upload your video from your device storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-privacy-setting.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Upload"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Manage-the-upload"><a href="#Step-4-Manage-the-upload" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Manage the upload"></a>Step 4: Manage the upload</h4><p>As soon as you have confirmed your video upload, you will find a progress bar on the screen.

Here are some things to be aware of if you want your videos to look great on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the number of pixels in your image. For example when a video has a resolution of 1080p that means it has a grid of pixels that is 1920 x 1080. The more pixels you have the sharper your image.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong>  Bitrate is a measurement of how compressed your file is, and the less compressed it is the more information there is per frame. Higher bitrates mean larger file sizes.</p><p>Your <strong>resolution</strong> and <strong>bitrate</strong> should complement each other. If you have a higher bitrate than is needed for your video’s resolution your file will be unnecessarily large. If your bitrate is too low for your resolution then you will not see the quality you expect.</p><p>YouTube has a list of recommended resolutions and bitrates at support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;1722171.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> the dimensions of your video, in terms of width and height. YouTube’s aspect ratio is 16:9, so your videos should also be 16:9. If they are not then you will get black bars on either side of your video after you upload it. The most common way that people end up with the wrong aspect ratio is by creating videos on their smartphones and holding them up and down instead of sideways.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-2"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Upload-Videos-to-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube"></a>Part 2: Steps to Upload Videos to YouTube</h2><p>Uploading YouTube Video on Desktop:</p><p>1.

And it is probably the most popular way or the easiest way to download a video, but the shortcoming of this video download site is that it doesn’t support download full HD video and it is not always working. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/video-download-sites-2.jpg"                      alt="Top 2 video download site"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151872/7443" target="_top" id="2151872">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151872" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151872/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> <strong>Top 2 savemedia.com</strong></p><p>Seems like savemedia.com has already merged with keep-tube. You don’t need to copy and paste URL to download videos with this video download sites either, simply replace the url youtube.com&#x2F;xxx with savemedia.com&#x2F;xxx and you will be redirected to the video download page of savemedia.com. It also has the desktop downloader called Vdownloader. Sometimes when the site tool doesn’t work, you can try Vdownloader to download videos. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/video-download-sites-3.jpg"                      alt="Top 3 video download site"                > </p><p><strong>Top 3 savevideo.me</strong> </p><p>It does’t say on this video download site that it supports to download videos, and if you try to copy and paste the url of a video on this site, it is also unable to analyze the URL. However, there is a simple workaround way, if you add the word “magic” between “you” and “tube” like <a class="link"   href="http://www.youmagictube.com/xxx" >www.youmagictube.com/xxx <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will be able to jump to the downloading page! Strange isn’t it. And this video download site also support to download MP3 audio directly and supports other video sites such as Dailymotion, Vine, etc. But be aware of the ads in case you accidently click it. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/video-download-sites-4.jpg"                      alt="Top 5 video download site"                > </p><p><strong>Top 4 Deturl</strong></p><p>This video download site is a bit different from others, it adapt the way of recording video and audio to download MP4 and MP3. If you want to use this site to download online videos, please be patient, because there is a “endless” redirect, and finally you will be able to download the MP4 or MP3 file only. There is also a simple way which is add “pwn” in front of the video URL, i.e. <a class="link"   href="http://www.pwnyoutube.com/xxx" >www.pwnyoutube.com/xxx <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and then you will go to the download page directly. </p><p>As a matter of fact, relying on a website to download online videos is not a long plan. Despite the ads or virus the sites may contain, lesson has been told that online video download sites are not stable, today it may be available like clipconverter.cc, and tomorrow it may be sued like YouTube-mp3.org, or it just occasionally not working like Keepvid.com. The best way to avoid someday you will try to find another alternative site to download online videos, you can just stick to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/" >5KPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – your default online video downloader software. </p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/"><img
