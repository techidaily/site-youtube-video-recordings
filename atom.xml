Thus, according to the rating of IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes (scoring above 8.0 and 80% respectively), here we list out <strong>37 quality Netflix HD movies</strong> from 2008 to 2015 (keep updating) to give you a clue.</p><p>Great news: Netflix is going to be the exclusive streaming service for Disney films in September 2016! Major theatrical movies produced by Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar are about to be streamed on Netflix, and we’ll update those movies into this list on time!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/5kp-aquaman-download-zjy.png"                      alt="Netflix HD Downloads"                > </p><p><strong>Choose 5KPlayer to Watch Netflix HD 1080P Movies Free</strong> </p><p>Instead of online 4K HD streaming, 5KPlayer allows you to get Netflix <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >HD 1080P movies downloaded free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from over <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >300+ online movie resources <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a flash and stream the Netflix HD films to HDTV. Since up to 3 GB per hour for each stream of HD video is required by Netflix, this free HD movie download&#x2F;streaming tool might save those Netflix subscribers who have a monthly bandwidth or data cap on the internet service from the dilemma between Netflix HD streaming and control of data use. </p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/button/freedownwhitewin.png"                                     ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/button/freedownbackmac.png"                                     ></a> </p><h4 id="Netflix-HD-List-of-Movies-2008-2016"><a href="#Netflix-HD-List-of-Movies-2008-2016" class="headerlink" title="Netflix HD List of Movies 2008-2016:"></a><strong>Netflix HD List of Movies 2008-2016:</strong></h4><p><strong>Best Netflix HD Films 2008</strong><br><em><strong>In Bruges</strong></em><br>(Action, Comedy, Crime;

We’ll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length"><a href="#Video-length" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><h3 id="Ad-Quality"><a href="#Ad-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes.

We’ll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length-1"><a href="#Video-length-1" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><h3 id="Ad-Quality-1"><a href="#Ad-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives-1"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives-1" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads’ revenue potential by increasing the ad’s number of clicks.

Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p><p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p><p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p><p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p><p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p><p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success.

This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion&#x2F;month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo"></a>Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo</h2><p>Before uploading your video on any one of these above-mentioned platforms the first thing you have to do is get your videos edited.

If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.</p><p>Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video.

Discoverability"></a><strong>1. Discoverability</strong></h4><p>Having a niche differentiates your channel from all the other ones on YouTube. There is no denying the crowded space on the video platform. Every minute, <a class="link"   href="https://merchdope.com/youtube-statistics/" >300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you were simply copying other YouTubers, it will be challenging to grow, as your content will be in the shadows of all the other ones.</p><h4 id="2-Consistency-3"><a href="#2-Consistency-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistency"></a><strong>2. Consistency</strong></h4><p>By having a consistent niche, your channel will be more coherent for those who discovered your awesome content and wants more related videos. If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.</p><p>For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.</p><h4 id="3-Credibility-3"><a href="#3-Credibility-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Credibility"></a><strong>3. Credibility</strong></h4><p>In a specialized niche, you can own it and become an expert on the topic. Increasing your credibility will allow you to build trust much faster with your audience and therefore, grow at a much faster rate.</p><h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche on YouTube"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche on YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube-3"><a href="#What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Your Objective On YouTube?"></a><strong>What Is Your Objective On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Do you want to make money? Do you want to fuel a passion? Do you want to educate the masses?</p><p>Your intentions on YouTube can be a numbers game: you want to get views, subscribers, and make money.</p><p>Or perhaps your intentions on YouTube can be to make content for a specific audience so that you can build a community.</p><p>Moreover, you might be using YouTube as the platform to showcase your personal brand and develop a reputation that you can bring to the real world.</p><p>Once you have a clear objective for what you want to achieve on YouTube, then you can consider the tactical direction to take your channel in: finding a niche and creating content for it.</p><h4 id="What-is-Your-Passion-3"><a href="#What-is-Your-Passion-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Your Passion?"></a><strong>What is Your Passion?</strong></h4><p>Building a YouTube channel is a grind and if you are not passionate about the topics you are covering in your niche, you may not have the motivation needed to churn out videos day after day, week after week.</p><p>Answering what you are passionate about isn’t enough to form your niche around, but it is definitely a critical part. <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-your-passion.html" >Start by finding your passion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Think of the things that you can do for hours without getting bored. Think of the hobbies you have where you put in hours and hours to improve. Think about all the research you’ve done on a given topic for no other reason than satisfying your own curiosity. These can all help you understand what you are most passionate about.</p><p>Knowing your passion opens an avenue for you to travel down in discovering your niche. But the journey isn’t over yet… there are few more questions to ask:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Expertises-3"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Expertises-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Expertises?"></a><strong>What Are Your Expertises?</strong></h4><p>Over the course of your life, you have gained experiences and skills — and you might not even know it. Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.</p><p>While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?</p><p>If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.</p><h4 id="What-Do-People-Know-You-For-3"><a href="#What-Do-People-Know-You-For-3" class="headerlink" title="What Do People Know You For?"></a><strong>What Do People Know You For?</strong></h4><p>If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?</p><p>If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.</p><p>Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:</p><p>- Can I teach people what I know?</p><p>- Will I want to learn more about this topic?</p><p>- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?</p><p>Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs-3"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?"></a><strong>What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?</strong></h4><p>If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.</p><p>When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:</p><p>- Educate</p><p>- Entertain</p><p>- Inspire</p><h4 id="Educate-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Educate-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Educate Your Audience"></a><strong>Educate Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question. If your content can teach, it will be valuable because it has real-world applications. (example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)</p><h4 id="Entertain-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Entertain-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Entertain Your Audience"></a><strong>Entertain Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal.

They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable"><a href="#2-Biteable" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.</p><p>This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.</p><h4 id="3-Tube-Arsenal"><a href="#3-Tube-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="3.

They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest"><a href="#4-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="4.

They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.</p><h4 id="5-Panzoid"><a href="#5-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzoid"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text.</em></p><p>Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).</p><h4 id="6-Intro-Cave"><a href="#6-Intro-Cave" class="headerlink" title="6.

However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.</p><p>Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-Wondershare Filmora"></a>YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a great video editor for all creators.

I will let you know the tutorial to turn in AV1 settings on YouTube and the reason why should choose AV1 along with the others, and some more things about AV1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?"></a>Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?</h2><p>Do you wonder how to turn on <strong>AV1 settings on YouTube</strong>? For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance"><a href="#Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to playback and performance"></a>Step1Go to playback and performance</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube settings"                ></p><ul><li>To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click “Playback and Performance”.</li><li>In the AV1 settings. Besides “Auto (Recommended)”, there are other two options, which are “Prefer AV1 for SD” and also “Always prefer SD”.</li><li>“Always Prefer AV1” uses the codec whenever it is available for a video while “Prefer AV1 for SD” limits it to SD videos. There are two options to avoid low-performance devices when AV1 videos are played on YouTube. You can select “Always Prefer AV1” to see if your device performance is good enough when you play videos on YouTube that support AV1.</li></ul><h5 id="Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video"><a href="#Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video"></a>Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="av1 settings"                ></p><p>You may ask how to confirm your YouTube videos are playing with AV1 Codec. Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords “<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1" >4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select “Stats for nerd”. If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?"></a>Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?</h2><p>Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123733/7443" target="_top" id="2123733">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123733" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123733/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3. AV2 to come in the future"></a>3. AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

Investigating Contemporary Substitutes for the Traditional Turing Challenge</h2><p> Over 70 years ago, when artificial intelligence was conceptualized, Alan Turing published a paper that described how to identify it. It was later known as the Turing test, and it has been used for decades to distinguish between a human and an AI.</p><p> However, with the introduction of advanced AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it’s becoming more difficult to tell if you’re talking to an AI. It begs the question; is the Turing test outdated? And if it is, what are the alternatives?</p><h2 id="Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated"><a href="#Is-the-Turing-Test-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Is the Turing Test Outdated?"></a>Is the Turing Test Outdated?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/man-questions-robot-turing-test-example-feature.jpg"                      alt="man questions robot turing test example feature"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jesus Sanz&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-scientist-facing-turing-test-artificial-1651840888" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To determine if the Turing test is outdated, you must first<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-turing-test-ever-beaten/" >understand how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For an AI to pass the Turing test, it must convince a human interrogator that it’s a human. But there is a catch—the AI is evaluated alongside a human, and it must respond using text.</p><p> Think of it like this; if you’re the interrogator, and you’re asking questions to two participants online using text, but one of them is an AI model—would you tell them apart after five minutes? Keep in mind that the objective of the Turing test is not to identify the AI model based on the correct answers but to evaluate if the AI can think or behave like a human.</p><p> The problem with the Turing test approach of only identifying human-like responses is that it doesn’t consider other factors. For instance, the intelligence of the AI model or the knowledge of the interrogator. Besides that, the Turing test is limited to text only, and it’s becoming more difficult to identify an AI that generates a human voice or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-are-deepfakes-explained/" >deepfake videos that imitate human behavior <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, the current AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard haven’t yet advanced to a point they can consistently pass the Turing test. In fact, if you’re familiar with AI, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-ai-writing-how-spot-ai-generated-text/" >spot AI-generated text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-Turing-Test-Alternatives"><a href="#The-5-Best-Turing-Test-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best Turing Test Alternatives"></a>The 5 Best Turing Test Alternatives</h2><p> It’s possible that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/when-will-gpt5-launch/" >future AI models like ChatGPT-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could pass the Turing test. If that happens, we would need different tests combined with the Turing test to identify if we’re talking to an AI or a human.

It works like the Turing test, but instead of answering questions using texts, participants are shown images and expected to answer simple questions while thinking like a human. However, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-do-captchas-work/" >visual Turing test is different from CAPTCHAs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since all the answers are correct—but to pass the test, the AI must process the images similarly to a human.</p><p> Beyond that, if an AI and a human are shown multiple images side by side and asked to identify realistic images, the human would have the cognitive ability to pass the test. This is because AI models find it difficult to distinguish images that don’t look like they were taken in the real world.

More succinctly, the AI classification framework is based on the theory of multiple intelligence, which requires human intelligence to satisfy at least eight different criteria, which include: musical-rhythm, logical-mathematical intelligence, visual identification, emotional intelligence, self-reflective intelligence, existential thinking ability, and body movement.</p><p> Since the AI is evaluated on eight different parameters, it’s unlikely to pass for a human even if it performs better than average in certain benchmarks. For instance,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-chatgpt-solve-math-problems/" >ChatGPT can solve math problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , describe images, and converse in a natural language like a human, but it would fail other categories defined in the AI classification framework.</p><h2 id="The-Turing-Test-Is-Not-Conclusive"><a href="#The-Turing-Test-Is-Not-Conclusive" class="headerlink" title="The Turing Test Is Not Conclusive"></a>The Turing Test Is Not Conclusive</h2><p> The Turing test was meant to be more of a thought experiment than a conclusive test to differentiate between humans and AI. When it was initially proposed, it was the pivotal benchmark for measuring machine intelligence.</p><p> However, with the recent development of AI models with speech, visual, and hearing interactive capabilities, the Turing test falls short since it’s limited to text conversation. The most effective solution would be to introduce Turing test alternatives that further differentiate AI models from humans.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-diy-dynamics-unlock-creative-animation-potential/"><u>[New] DIY Dynamics Unlock Creative Animation Potential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-best-6-gopro-mounts-for-seamless-capture/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Best 6 GoPro Mounts for Seamless Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-tips.techidaily.com/1-quick-and-easy-methods-for-converting-cda-audio-files-into-mp3-format/"><u>1.

Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games.

If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over.

Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>From hardcore gamers to anybody who likes watching adults freak out about zombies, a lot of people really enjoy gaming vlogs.

When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management-2"><a href="#3-Time-Management-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p><p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p><p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p><h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion-2"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p><p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p><p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>From hardcore gamers to anybody who likes watching adults freak out about zombies, a lot of people really enjoy gaming vlogs. YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p><p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p><hr><p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p><h4 id="1-Equipment-3"><a href="#1-Equipment-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"                      alt="gamer elgato"                ></p><p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p><p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p><p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p><p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p><h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice-3"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p><p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p><h4 id="3-Time-Management-3"><a href="#3-Time-Management-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Then, go to the “My Channel” panel and select the video that you want to cut. Once you’ve done this, click on the “Video manager” option and click on the “create” tab which should be located on the right side for the page. There, you will be able to find the “Video Editor”.

Keep in mind that the videos are made out of a maximum of 50 clips. The site is going to save every single video that you upload as a particular clip which could be properly combined with the rest in order to make one larger video. This is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-video-to-youtube-timeline.jpg"                      alt="drag video to YouTube timeline"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-the-Length"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-the-Length" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Edit the Length"></a>Step 3 Edit the Length</h4><p>This is the part where you actually get to edit the length of your video. In order to do so effectively, you have to drag the bar at either end of your clip towards the other end in order to shorten the clip conveniently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-length-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="edit video length in youtube"                ></p><p>What is more, if you want to increase the length, you have to drag the bar to the opposite end – outwards. There is going to be an indicator which is going to appear at the bottom of the clip, and it’s going to show you the overall duration of the file, and it’s going to adjust itself as you slide the bars accordingly.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Save-the-Clip"><a href="#Step-4-Save-the-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Save the Clip"></a>Step 4 Save the Clip</h4><p>Of course, you would have to save the clip in order for the changes to reflect.

To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want.

There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing).

To use this, double click on a specific clip in your imported video and open the custom speed settings. Use the adjusting meter beside speed to make your clip as fast or slow as you want. You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing).

You may use the same feature to introduce the slow-motion effects in certain areas of the video.</p><p>Now, when you are using either the fast-forward or slow-motion effects, it is best to have stable video footage with consistent lighting and a static background. There are also the options of Reverse Speed that can play the clip backward, as in flash-back. The Ripple edit feature allows you to cut short a long clip seamlessly.</p><p><strong>Jump Cut:</strong> The Jump Cut is about snipping unwanted areas in the clip. It may sound like the Ripple edit mentioned above, but the ripple edit is more functional for cutting short a continuous video so that the viewer won’t realize the snip. For the Jump Cut, it doesn’t have to be a constant clip. You can get to the next frame or scene with an abracadabra move.</p><p>To use Jump Cut, place the cursor over the starting of the clip that you want to cut, and right-click on it and select <strong>“Split”</strong> (the <strong>“scissors”</strong> feature on the toolbar does the same thing). To make this look neat, preview the portion of the clip once again and delete the cuts between two clips with the same right-click.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-3"><a href="#Step-4-Understanding-Transitions-on-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora"></a>Step 4: Understanding Transitions on Filmora</h4><p>Transitions make your video more interactive and help you segregate the video from frame-to-frame with effects like dissolve, fade, flash, etc. there are numerous transition options available within the Filmora suit.</p><p>The best way to do this drag and drop the clips on the timeline is to trim parts of the clip to shorten it. Once you have all the clips in place, go to the <strong>“Transitions”</strong> options at the top toolbar to apply it on the end or start of each clip.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits-3"><a href="#Step-5-Audio-Playback-Sound-Edits-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits"></a>Step 5: Audio, Playback &amp; Sound Edits</h4><p>There are plenty of options that you can remove background noise, add voiceover, add music, and detach audio from video.

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3.

Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>3.

Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition-3"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name-3"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-3"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory-3"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

Twitch.tv is well-known for its live streaming services, but it is also available for everyone to <strong>download Twitch videos and clips</strong>.</p><p>However, there are two different situations. If you are a regular user of Twitch, you only have up to 14 days to save your past broadcasts before the videos are deleted from the Twitch’s server. While for Twitch Partners, Turbo and Prime users, they have 60 days. What does it mean? It means, registered or unregistered, you have up to 2 months to download Twitch videos and clips.</p><p>It’s quite easy to download your own Twitch streams you broadcasted, but how about those from others? Here provides several free ways to get Twitch live streams and VODs quickly as a charm.</p><p><strong>Main Contents</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/" >1.
