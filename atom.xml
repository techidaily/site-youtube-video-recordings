Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video. Also, adding effects and filters on the video using an editor like Wondershare Filmora can help.</p><p>Users can subscribe to Shorts channels. And if they see that your videos are well-edited and high-quality, they’ll be more likely to do so. Once they are subscribed, they will see and watch your videos more often.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal-1"><a href="#Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal-1" class="headerlink" title="Q7.

Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube.

Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router.

This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos.

What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>You use YouTube to watch videos, post your own content, and build up a following. That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work-3"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload-3" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Yes, the YouTube Partner Program gives creators access to start generating revenue with their channel once they reach a minimum of 1,000 YouTube subscribers and 4,000 watch ours in the last twelve months.</p><p>For anyone looking to start earning passive income via YouTube, but have the question, <strong>“Does YouTube pay monthly?” The answer is YES YouTube pays monthly</strong>. However, there are other things you must know if you want to start making money from YouTube. So, in this article, we will discuss all you need to know about how often YouTube pays and other YouTube monetization tips.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Affiliate Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Brand Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Selling Own Products or Services</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">More FAQs About How Much YouTubers Make</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-Often-Does-YouTube-Pay"><a href="#Part-1-How-Often-Does-YouTube-Pay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Often Does YouTube Pay"></a>Part 1: How Often Does YouTube Pay</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, YouTube pays monthly. It’s usually within the first 10-14 days of a new month (10th day or 14th day of a new month). However, to be able to receive your funds, you must reach the minimum threshold of your local currency as required by YouTube. For example, $100 for content creators within the United States.</p><p>Also, you must comply with the YouTube monetization policies and not be suspended by YouTube in the past month.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Pay-–-Typical-Methods-Used"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Pay-–-Typical-Methods-Used" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Pay – Typical Methods Used"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Pay – Typical Methods Used</h2><p>Research shows that YouTube’s average pay rate is within the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per ad view. This means for every 1,000 ad views, a YouTuber could earn $18, while for every 1,000 video views, you could earn $3 to $5. You might ask “Does YouTube pay creators per view?’ Well, the answer is NO, YouTube doesn’t pay creators per view.

A good rule of thumb is to choose solutions that auto generates the captions as they save you a lot of time. If there are issues after the captions have been generated, you can then use a subtitled editor to fix them, more preferable to typing in the subtitles or captions yourself.</p><p>**<strong>How Do I Get Automatic Captions for my Video?</strong></p><p>If you are uploading your video on YouTube, you can easily generate automatic captions from the YouTube studio. Just use these simple steps;</p><p>Step 1: Sign in to YouTube Studio and in the left menu, select “Subtitles.”</p><p>Step 2: Click on the video that you want to add subtitles</p><p>Step 3: Select “More” under Subtitles and then go through the captions to make sure they are correct. If not, you can edit them on this page.</p><p>If you are not using YouTube to share your video, you can use one of the solutions we have outlined in this article to generate automatic captions.</p><p>**<strong>How Long Does It Take to Caption a Video?</strong></p><p>The amount of time that you spend creating a caption for your video is entirely dependent on the captioning tool that you use. Automatic caption generators can create captions in a few seconds but manual subtitle tools can lengthen the process, especially for a longer video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Captions are a great way to get users to engage with your videos.

Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)</h2><p>The biggest problem with the mic built into any camera or phone is just that, since it’s with the camera, it’s usually too far away from you. Built-in mics can record decent audio up close, but usually, your camera will be set up farther away from you than an external mic would be.</p><p>For example, your camera’s mic might be just as good as a clip-on LAV, but that LAV is right by your mouth and the camera is a couple of big steps away.</p><p>Moving your camera&#x2F;smartphone physically closer to you will make it hard to include anything besides your head and shoulders in your shot, but it will get you significantly better audio.</p><h2 id="2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet"><a href="#2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet" class="headerlink" title="2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet"></a>2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet</h2><p>The best way to limit the amount of background noise you pick up in your sound recording is to shoot somewhere where there’s no background noise. That probably seems really basic, but it’s something a lot of people just don’t do. It’s easy to default to recording in your home office, even though it’s right next to the kitchen where your family is bustling around, or in your bedroom even though there’s a busy street right outside your window.</p><p>Sometimes the best thing you can do for your audio is simply to scout out a quiet room in your house where the sound recording conditions are better.

If you try to record in a room that’s too big your voice might sound to distant, and if you try to record in a room that’s too small your audio will be too echo-y. You need a room that’s just right.</p><p>You should also pay attention to what’s in the room you’re recording in. Avoid hard, reflective, surfaces like appliances and mirrors which your voice will bounce off of. The same conditions that make you sound great when you sing in the shower will – like recording in a small space -make your voiceover unpleasantly echo-y.</p><p>Look for a room that has a lot of soft things in it, like beds and sofas.</p><h2 id="4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind"><a href="#4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind" class="headerlink" title="4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind"></a>4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind</h2><p>If you shoot outside, then the wind passing over your built-in mic will do terrible things to your audio. You can do a lot to counter-act this problem by physically blocking the wind.</p><p>There are a few ways to do this. If you’re doing hand-held shots you can partially cover your camera or phone’s mic with your finger. You don’t want to completely cover it&#x2F;press down or your audio will be muffled. What you’re trying to do is create a barrier blocking out the wind.</p><p>On movie sets, they block out wind by covering the microphones with big fuzzy things called ‘dead cats’. You can also block out wind noise by attaching something fuzzy to your microphone. If your camera’s built-in mic is on front of it then you just need something big and fluffy you can loop around the lens. You can use a piece of a boa, a fuzzy novelty scrunchie – you can even murder a fuzzy stuffed animal! Do you have an old coat with a fuzz around the hood? That fuzz would do nicely.</p><p><em>The pompom used in this video cost $2, but you might already have something that would work!</em></p><p>If your built-in mic is on top of your camera you can get something called a ‘micromuff’. A micromuff is essentially a circular or rectangular piece of velcro with long strands of fluff on top. It’s open in the middle so it doesn’t actually cover your mic, but the surrounding fuzz blocks out the wind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-better-audio-from-wind.jpg"                      alt="Record better audio from wind with micromuff"                ></p><p><em>You use the adhesive backing to attach the base velcro to your camera. The other side of the velcro has your fluff attached to the back.</em></p><p>The only thing about a micromuff is that it costs about $30, and if you’re going to spend $30 on audio equipment then you could just buy yourself an inexpensive LAV mic. I only bring up the micromuff because it’s a very simple design you can probably DIY – you just need velcro with adhesive backing and any of the fluff-sources we just discussed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App"><a href="#5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App" class="headerlink" title="5.

Built-in mics can record decent audio up close, but usually, your camera will be set up farther away from you than an external mic would be.</p><p>For example, your camera’s mic might be just as good as a clip-on LAV, but that LAV is right by your mouth and the camera is a couple of big steps away.</p><p>Moving your camera&#x2F;smartphone physically closer to you will make it hard to include anything besides your head and shoulders in your shot, but it will get you significantly better audio.</p><h2 id="2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet-2"><a href="#2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet"></a>2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet</h2><p>The best way to limit the amount of background noise you pick up in your sound recording is to shoot somewhere where there’s no background noise.

If you’re doing hand-held shots you can partially cover your camera or phone’s mic with your finger. You don’t want to completely cover it&#x2F;press down or your audio will be muffled.

You can also block out wind noise by attaching something fuzzy to your microphone. If your camera’s built-in mic is on front of it then you just need something big and fluffy you can loop around the lens. You can use a piece of a boa, a fuzzy novelty scrunchie – you can even murder a fuzzy stuffed animal! Do you have an old coat with a fuzz around the hood? That fuzz would do nicely.</p><p><em>The pompom used in this video cost $2, but you might already have something that would work!</em></p><p>If your built-in mic is on top of your camera you can get something called a ‘micromuff’.

A lot of the time, your audio recording app will also let you edit your audio afterward.</p><p>Even if you’re not recording video from your smartphone, it might be a good idea to use your phone as your mic and record a separate audio file. You’ll be able to use an app to fine-tune your recording, and you can set your phone up closer to you the way you would an external mic while keeping your camera back a bit farther.</p><p>Free audio apps: Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Android), RecForge II (Android), Smart Voice Recorder (Android), Audio Memos (iOS), and Recorder Plus (iOS).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe id="iframe_672" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/gen-ad-code/5597632/1959812/17834/" width="720" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 6\.

If you’re planning to vlog all throughout your day with your phone, you need a portable way to charge it back up. RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels. A 22,000 mAh charger goes for about $42 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount"><a href="#2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount" class="headerlink" title="2.

Not only does it have bendable legs, like the more expensive Joby GorillaPod tripod, that you can wrap around all kinds of structures, but it also comes with the smartphone mount, which Joby sells separately. Another great thing about the Arkon tripod is that its smartphone mount can be rotated so that you can position your phone to film in either widescreen or portrait mode.</p><h3 id="3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case"><a href="#3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case" class="headerlink" title="3.

These cases can stick to glass, mirrors, metal, and more. They range from $20 to $30 USD.</p><h3 id="4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light"><a href="#4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="4.

In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me" class="headerlink" title="5. RODE VideoMic Me"></a>5.

This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set" class="headerlink" title="6.

The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD.

The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone-1"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD. This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System-1"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System"></a>8.

RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels.

In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me-2"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone.

The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone-2"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone-2" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories.

If you’re planning to vlog all throughout your day with your phone, you need a portable way to charge it back up. RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels. A 22,000 mAh charger goes for about $42 USD.</p><h3 id="2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount-3"><a href="#2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Arkon Tripod Mount"></a>2.

Not only does it have bendable legs, like the more expensive Joby GorillaPod tripod, that you can wrap around all kinds of structures, but it also comes with the smartphone mount, which Joby sells separately. Another great thing about the Arkon tripod is that its smartphone mount can be rotated so that you can position your phone to film in either widescreen or portrait mode.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case-3"><a href="#3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me-3"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set-3"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System-3"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

The type of the video you’ll need to produce in order to attract the attention to your company’s services is directly related to the content you want to feature in that video. Demonstration videos are perfectly suited for display of the product’s capabilities, while customer testimonials will enable you to share first-hand experiences of your loyal customers with the rest of the world.</p><p>Everyone wants to hear a tale well told, and choosing the Internet as a place where your videos will be shown is the right choice, since 39% of company executives will call the service provider after watching a video that tells the story of your brand. Business relies on trust, which makes establishing a strong connection to your target group all the more important, and moving images are much more likely to establish that connection than written content. Furthermore, an average Internet user spends 16 minutes per day watching online video ads, make sure that at least one minute belongs to you, through unique and thought-provoking content.</p><h3 id="Social-Media-as-Means-of-Reaching-Larger-Audiences"><a href="#Social-Media-as-Means-of-Reaching-Larger-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Social Media as Means of Reaching Larger Audiences"></a>Social Media as Means of Reaching Larger Audiences</h3><p>If no one knows about your brand, then it is hard to sell the services you are offering, regardless of how world-changing they are.

In fact, there are several other means that can help you with that. Some of the practical ways that YouTube and Google allow you to earn through include:</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube Shorts Fund is a $100 million fund that is to be distributed from 2021 to 2022. It was introduced in May 2021 as the first step for YouTube Shorts monetization. YouTube Shorts creators that meet the requirements of the fund will receive the bonus.</p><p>To be eligible for the YouTube Shorts Fund bouns, you will need to meet the below requirements.</p><ul><li>Publish one eligible Short in the last 180 days.</li><li>Your channel does not conflict with the YouTube Community Guidelines, copyright rules, or monetization policies.</li><li>Content needs to be original and unique on the YouTube Shorts platform. Uploading movie clips or re-uploading videos from other video platforms are not allowed.</li><li>The creator must be 13 or older.</li><li><strong>Revenue by Advertisement</strong></li></ul><p>With this method, you can have advertisements displayed on your regular YouTube videos.

You can also publish your YouTube Shorts video on your channel and the Shorts Shelf.

As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg"                      alt="Locate enhancements features"                ></p><p> Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="Qucik Fix"                ></p><p> Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Filters"                ></p><p> Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Costum Blurring"                ></p><p> Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video.

As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg"                      alt="Locate enhancements features"                ></p><p> Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="Qucik Fix"                ></p><p> Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Filters"                ></p><p> Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Costum Blurring"                ></p><p> Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos"></a>How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos</h2><p> These are the steps that you need to follow, so as to proceed with high-quality video editing on Filmora:</p><ul><li>Open Wordershare Filmora</li><li>Choose if you want 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio</li><li>Tap Import so as to upload the files</li><li>Drag and drop them, in order to place them in the right order</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg"                      alt="Import Video"                ></p><ul><li>Click Edit and adjust the settings (rotation, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, auto de-noise and speed)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg"                      alt="Adjust Contrast Saturation"                ></p><ul><li>Click OK, and you are done with the improvement of Video Quality</li></ul><p> If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:</p><ul><li>Tap the Effect button</li><li>Drag the effect you want to use on the timeline (you can choose from a wide variety of effects, including Bokeh and Light Leaks, Old Film, etc.)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-movie-special-effects.jpg"                      alt="Free Movie Special Effect"                ></p><p> After having finished with the video editing process, you can preview the video and see if it is of acceptable quality standards.

You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Filters"                ></p><p> Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Costum Blurring"                ></p><p> Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited.

You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now.

This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original.

Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p><p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p><p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p><p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul.jpg"                      alt="jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul"                ></p><p>Image resource: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42548207/logan-and-jake-paul-the-brothers-dominating-social-media" >BBC NEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p><p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p><h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry.

The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p><p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p><p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p><h2 id="What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul-2"><a href="#What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul-2" class="headerlink" title="What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?"></a><strong>What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?</strong></h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Quick Follower Growth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Through First-Mover Advantage</strong></p><p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform.

Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p><p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla.

The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-team-10.jpg.jpg"                      alt="Jake Paul and Team 10"                ></p><p>Image resource:venturebeat.com</p><p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p><p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p><p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p><h2 id="What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul-3"><a href="#What-About-Social-Media-Success-Can-We-Learn-From-Jake-Paul-3" class="headerlink" title="What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?"></a><strong>What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?</strong></h2><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Quick Follower Growth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Through First-Mover Advantage</strong></p><p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Know Your Audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p><p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p><p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.</p><h3 id="Get-the-ultimate-guide-to-growing-your-YouTube-subscribers-3"><a href="#Get-the-ultimate-guide-to-growing-your-YouTube-subscribers-3" class="headerlink" title="Get the ultimate guide to growing your YouTube subscribers"></a>Get <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the ultimate guide to growing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Do you want to be a YouTuber?

Your <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> will increase by 0.25 as you keep tapping.</p><p>To reduce the <strong>playback speed YouTube</strong> videos, the reverse is the case.

With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Video-Platform-Economics-A-Tale-of-Two-Titles’-Income-Potentials"><a href="#Video-Platform-Economics-A-Tale-of-Two-Titles’-Income-Potentials" class="headerlink" title="Video Platform Economics: A Tale of Two Titles’ Income Potentials"></a>Video Platform Economics: A Tale of Two Titles’ Income Potentials</h2><p>Online video creators are always searching for ways to make their passion profitable.

Unlike YouTube, Dailymotion allows creators to earn money through ads.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program has made several French video creators extremely wealthy. The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg"                      alt="programs and options for dailymotion monetization"                ></p><h3 id="Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1"><a href="#Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential"></a>Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential</h3><p>YouTube’s YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising. You’ll get 55% of the revenue generated by the ads shown during, before, and after your videos. It is also possible to charge channel memberships. For every 1,000 views, the average YouTuber makes about $18.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program monetizes your videos. The least number of views you need to monetize your content is 1,000 (combined). One hour of watch time on the platform generates $57 in income, making it a great way to make money!</p><h3 id="Choosing-Between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Channel-Monetization-1"><a href="#Choosing-Between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Channel-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="Choosing Between YouTube and Dailymotion Channel Monetization"></a>Choosing Between YouTube and Dailymotion Channel Monetization</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-5.jpg"                      alt="choosing between dailymotion and youtube"                ></p><p>Now that you’ve seen a YouTube vs. Dailymotion comparison, you are leaning toward one. Let’s dive into some key questions if you’re still not sure ( you can use both platforms ):</p><ul><li>Do you have a specific group in mind? It’s important to think about who your audience is.</li><li>Are Your Videos Targeted? Do your videos match specific search queries?</li><li>Video Length and Size: How long and big are your videos?</li><li>Monetization: Want to make money? Consider your subscriber count.</li><li>Privacy Control: How much control do you need over your content’s privacy?</li><li>Analytics: Do you want detailed data on your video performance?</li></ul><p>YouTube is your best bet if you want organic search traffic, a wide audience, and hefty videos. If you want privacy control, or if you want to monetize, Dailymotion shines.</p><p>Whatever you pick, remember to add captions to your videos. Transcription tools can help with that, making your content more accessible and engaging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Enhance-Your-Monetization-Journey-with-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Video-Editing-Solution-1"><a href="#Part-3-Enhance-Your-Monetization-Journey-with-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Video-Editing-Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3.

Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3.

TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over.

Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.</p><p> <strong>4.</strong> The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-5"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-5" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>The traditional annotation’s features are replaced by its successor YouTube Cards and End Screen.

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP. Each method has advantages and disadvantages; the best one depends on your specific needs and preferences.

With these dimensions in mind, let’s dive into how you can easily create stunning thumbnails for your YouTube videos using your mobile phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-make-thumbnail-for-youtube-in-mobile.jpg"                      alt="make thumbnails or youtube with mobile phones"                ></p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-on-iPhone-With-the-iPhone-Photos-App"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-on-iPhone-With-the-iPhone-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

Here are some of the features you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Crop:</strong> The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.</li><li><strong>Rotate:</strong> The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.</li><li><strong>Adjust lighting and color:</strong> The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.</li><li><strong>Add text:</strong> You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.</li><li><strong>Add filters and stickers:</strong> The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.</li></ul><p>To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. <strong>Tap</strong> on the image to open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-photo-app.jpg"                      alt="ios photo app"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the top right corner of the screen.

If your art does not look like it all goes together then people will get a sloppy, amateurish, impression of your channel. However, if your different pieces of channel art all seem to complement each other and match the tone and theme of your channel then it will help viewers to have a pleasant browsing experience. They will get the impression that you take your YouTube channel seriously and that they can trust you as a source of information, comedy, or general entertainment.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-YouTube-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-YouTube-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails"></a>How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails</h2><p>YouTube Banners and Thumbnails are two of the most important pieces of channel art you will need. This article will explain the best practices for both, and suggest sites where you will be able to build your own banners and thumbnails for free.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#1-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube Banners"></a>1. YouTube Banners</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>The image you upload for your YouTube banner should be 2560 x 1440px (pixels).</li><li>The ‘safe area’ for text, logos, and other important visual information (like faces) is 1546 x 423px.</li></ol><p>Your banner is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about channel art. Banners are the headers that rest at the tops of channel pages on YouTube. Your banner should be 2560 x 1440 px, although not all of it will always be visible. On a desktop computer or mobile device only a 1546 x 423 px ‘safe area’ will be visible. When viewed on a TV screen your entire image will be visible. YouTube does support PNG, but if your PNG file does not upload properly (as has been the case for some YouTubers) then changing your file type to JPEG might help.</p><p>YouTube Banners are extremely important to the success of your channel. If you do not have a banner then it looks like you do not really care about your vlog. If you have a basic banner that is not at all personalized then it certainly looks like you care, but it might also look like you are new to YouTube.</p><p>The best banners are customized to reflect the kind of experience you want viewers to have on your channel. The banner of a comedic YouTube channel might use bright colors, where the banner for a gaming channel will probably use darker colors similar to the ones that are in the games the vlogger plays. Connecting your banner to the theme of your channel is part of how you define the style of your vlog. It is the difference between being a Beauty Guru and a general YouTuber who gives makeup tips sometimes.</p><p>Including a photo of yourself, or your logo if you have one, is a great way to personalize your banner.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Thumbnails"></a>2. YouTube Thumbnails</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>Search for your video’s topic to see the thumbnails your thumbnail will be competing against.</li><li>Make any text huge so people can read it on their smartphone screens.</li><li>Emojis, colored boarders, and graphics are all potential ways to stand out.</li></ol><p>Thumbnails are often ignored by newer YouTubers. YouTube selects a thumbnail for every one of your videos and it is always a still image from that video. You can choose which frame you want to use and a lot of people feel like that is good enough. When you create a custom thumbnail, however, you get to not only choose your image but insert a title.</p><p>If you are choosing the images you are using for thumbnails you can make sure they are always similar frames. This will help people identify your videos quickly in searches. Using titles in your thumbnails will also help searchers identify your videos, if you always use the same title style. Another benefit of titles is that they capture the attention of people looking for your specific topic. Remember when building your thumbnails that they will appear smaller on YouTube than they probably are while you edit them. On mobile devices, they will look even smaller. So, if you are going to use text in your thumbnail, make sure it is huge.</p><p>One thumbnail taboo that you should never break is using an image that has nothing to do with your video. Using an image of a cute cat for a vlog post that has nothing to do with cats is misleading and will anger viewers. You may draw in a lot of viewers who want to see a cat video, but they will leave right away when they do not see a cat and they will never watch anything by you again.</p><h4 id="3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails"><a href="#3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails"></a>3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails</h4><p>There are sites online that will allow you to edit images and use them in templates for YouTube banners. You can also use these services to edit your thumbnails. Two of the most popular, free, online photo editors are PicMonkey.com and Canva.com.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-Canva.JPG"                      alt="banner n thumb Canva"                ></p><p><strong>Canva</strong> has templates you can use to create YouTube banners, as well as a variety of stock images you can use in combination with your own when creating channel art.

They will get the impression that you take your YouTube channel seriously and that they can trust you as a source of information, comedy, or general entertainment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails<p>YouTube Banners and Thumbnails are two of the most important pieces of channel art you will need. This article will explain the best practices for both, and suggest sites where you will be able to build your own banners and thumbnails for free.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-Banners-1"><a href="#1-YouTube-Banners-1" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube Banners"></a>1. YouTube Banners</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>The image you upload for your YouTube banner should be 2560 x 1440px (pixels).</li><li>The ‘safe area’ for text, logos, and other important visual information (like faces) is 1546 x 423px.</li></ol><p>Your banner is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about channel art. Banners are the headers that rest at the tops of channel pages on YouTube. Your banner should be 2560 x 1440 px, although not all of it will always be visible. On a desktop computer or mobile device only a 1546 x 423 px ‘safe area’ will be visible. When viewed on a TV screen your entire image will be visible. YouTube does support PNG, but if your PNG file does not upload properly (as has been the case for some YouTubers) then changing your file type to JPEG might help.</p><p>YouTube Banners are extremely important to the success of your channel. If you do not have a banner then it looks like you do not really care about your vlog. If you have a basic banner that is not at all personalized then it certainly looks like you care, but it might also look like you are new to YouTube.</p><p>The best banners are customized to reflect the kind of experience you want viewers to have on your channel. The banner of a comedic YouTube channel might use bright colors, where the banner for a gaming channel will probably use darker colors similar to the ones that are in the games the vlogger plays. Connecting your banner to the theme of your channel is part of how you define the style of your vlog. It is the difference between being a Beauty Guru and a general YouTuber who gives makeup tips sometimes.</p><p>Including a photo of yourself, or your logo if you have one, is a great way to personalize your banner.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#2-YouTube-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Thumbnails"></a>2. YouTube Thumbnails</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>Search for your video’s topic to see the thumbnails your thumbnail will be competing against.</li><li>Make any text huge so people can read it on their smartphone screens.</li><li>Emojis, colored boarders, and graphics are all potential ways to stand out.</li></ol><p>Thumbnails are often ignored by newer YouTubers. YouTube selects a thumbnail for every one of your videos and it is always a still image from that video. You can choose which frame you want to use and a lot of people feel like that is good enough. When you create a custom thumbnail, however, you get to not only choose your image but insert a title.</p><p>If you are choosing the images you are using for thumbnails you can make sure they are always similar frames. This will help people identify your videos quickly in searches. Using titles in your thumbnails will also help searchers identify your videos, if you always use the same title style. Another benefit of titles is that they capture the attention of people looking for your specific topic. Remember when building your thumbnails that they will appear smaller on YouTube than they probably are while you edit them. On mobile devices, they will look even smaller. So, if you are going to use text in your thumbnail, make sure it is huge.</p><p>One thumbnail taboo that you should never break is using an image that has nothing to do with your video. Using an image of a cute cat for a vlog post that has nothing to do with cats is misleading and will anger viewers. You may draw in a lot of viewers who want to see a cat video, but they will leave right away when they do not see a cat and they will never watch anything by you again.</p><h4 id="3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails"></a>3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails</h4><p>There are sites online that will allow you to edit images and use them in templates for YouTube banners.

Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.</p><p>This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#How-To-Turn-On-Captions-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Turn On Captions on YouTube"></a>How To Turn On Captions on YouTube</h2><p>In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG"                      alt="captions"                ></p><p>To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.</p><p>If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your <strong>Account Settings</strong> and selecting <strong>Playback</strong>. Check the box next to <strong>Always Show Captions</strong>, and then check   <strong>Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition</strong>. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The <strong>Always Show Captions</strong> feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.</p><p>If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   <strong>Subtitles&#x2F;CC</strong> . If the language you want is not there select <strong>Auto-Translate</strong>  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.</p><h2 id="Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps-3"><a href="#Adding-YouTube-Captions-in-4-Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps"></a>Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to <strong>Video Manager</strong> in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.</p><p>2. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose <strong>Subtitles and CC</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Add New</strong> <strong>Subtitles or CC</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.</p><p><strong>Create Subtitles or Closed Captions</strong> will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Upload A File</strong> allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and Set Timings</strong> is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.</p><p><strong>Use Automatic Captioning</strong> will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.</p><p><strong>Use Captioning Software or Services</strong> is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.</p><p>The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use <strong>Automatic Captioning</strong>. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
