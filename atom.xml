Mamoru Oshii is not so much a tech expertise as he is a philosophic thinker who mixes his humanistic concern into those cold scientific structures. Different from the robot perspective in Ghost In The Shell, Patlabor takes human perspective like Will Smith’s I, Robot to mock the robotic future. Since Oshii was once a Christian and the Babylon project here in Patlabor can be compared with BABEL tower project in the Bible. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/free-anime-download-5.jpg"                      alt="Twilight Q Free Anime Poster"                > </p><p> <strong>No. 6 Twilight Q Free Anime Download</strong> </p><p>A Paranormal science fiction anime that contains two parts – Time Knot: Reflection directed by Tomomi and Mystery article file 538 directed by Oshii. It received vast different reviews. The first part is about a girl discovering herself kissing a man she couldn’t recall in a photo which was taken by the camera she found during snorkeling. She gradually got lost in the currents of time as she dives into the mystery of the camera. The second part is about a detective trying to connect the facts between an airplane’s disappearance with a strange pair of father and daughter until one day the detective lost himself and finds he is the father of the daughter and sending another detective to investigate, fallen into the Mobius ring maze of existence. You’ll get overwhelmed by the larger concept Oshii was trying to manifest with his philosophic mind. Very typical Janpanese distorted stories. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.5kplayer.com/youtube-download/img/free-anime-download-6.jpg"                      alt="Paranoia Agent Free Anime Poster"                > </p><p> <strong>No. 7 Paranoia Agent Free Anime Download</strong> </p><p>This is a 13 episodes anime series that personifies everyone’s inner demon in the form of a young baseball player in roller skates wielding a baseball bat.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers.

A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.</p><p>You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.</p><p>Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.</p><h4 id="How-To-Make-an-End-Card-3"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-End-Card-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an End Card"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Make an End Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><ol><li>Choose a static background.

These are a sort of expert tips given by photographers based on their practical experience. First of all, you have to understand that a video can be made vintage, but you can’t change the actual environment of shooting. Some editing always involves there in every project out there. Still, the tips given below will help you a lot in creating a retro look.</p><h4 id="Use-Vintage-Lenses-1"><a href="#Use-Vintage-Lenses-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Vintage Lenses"></a>Use Vintage Lenses</h4><p>The very first helpful tip is to use a vintage lens. They allow chromatic aberration by distorting colors around the frame. Furthermore, you can find various kinds of lenses in terms of a vintage effect.</p><h4 id="Decrease-Contrast-1"><a href="#Decrease-Contrast-1" class="headerlink" title="Decrease Contrast"></a>Decrease Contrast</h4><p>Do the correct color grading by reducing the contrast a little bit. You must not level the retro videos in black or white or like-new videos. You can simply add a contrasting effect and then reduce it to have that vintage look.</p><h4 id="Keep-it-a-little-soft-1"><a href="#Keep-it-a-little-soft-1" class="headerlink" title="Keep it a little soft"></a>Keep it a little soft</h4><p>If you have ever noticed, the vintage videos are a little soft and look like degraded with time. It’s a result of decreased sharpness in the camera’s menu settings. You can even add a slight blur to the final video or simply use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >recognized software made for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Brighten-up-the-black-levels-1"><a href="#Brighten-up-the-black-levels-1" class="headerlink" title="Brighten up the black levels"></a>Brighten up the black levels</h4><p>Lots of black points in the video are not ideal for a vintage effect. The suitable approach is to bring up black levels and make it dark gray instead of inky black. This look can be achieved either by levels effect or curves effect in your editing software.</p><h4 id="Reduce-Saturation-levels-1"><a href="#Reduce-Saturation-levels-1" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Saturation levels"></a>Reduce Saturation levels</h4><p>Bringing down the saturation levels is another tip to create a vintage effect. The old videos are also absent in bright colors. Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor.

Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers. These centers could cost as much as $600 million dollars each and consume huge amounts of electricity. There are six of them in the United States, three in Europe, two in Asia, and one is South America.</p><h4 id="3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3"><a href="#3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-directing-content-flow-uploading-imovie-films-to-youtube/"><u>[New] Directing Content Flow Uploading IMovie Films to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/our-shorts-are-here-no-more-waiting-game/"><u>[New] Your Shorts Are Here – No More Waiting Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-14-youtube-adsense-earnings-how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views/"><u>[Updated] 14- YouTube AdSense Earnings How Much Does AdSense Pay per 1,000 Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-complete-beginners-manual-to-using-final-cut-pro/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Beginner's Manual to Using Final Cut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-stream-your-webcam-in-real-time-using-vlc-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Stream Your Webcam in Real Time Using VLC Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-mac-video-frames-catalog-max-156-chars-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Mac Video Frames Catalog (Max 156 Chars) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/10-proven-methods-for-restoring-iphone-cellular-internet-service/"><u>10 Proven Methods for Restoring iPhone Cellular Internet Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-efficient-deletion-techniques-for-online-discussions/"><u>2024 Approved Efficient Deletion Techniques for Online Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/achieve-stellar-clickthrough-rates-via-thumbnail-enlargement-on-youtube/"><u>Achieve Stellar Clickthrough Rates via Thumbnail Enlargement on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/choosing-youtube-premium-what-makes-it-worth-the-price/"><u>Choosing YouTube Premium What Makes It Worth the Price?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/free-frameworks-amplify-your-youtube-vision/"><u>Free Frameworks Amplify Your YouTube Vision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-beyond-youtube-elite-video-sharing-hubs-revealed/"><u>In 2024, Beyond YouTube Elite Video Sharing Hubs Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 to Other Android Devices Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimize-your-viewing-experience-adjust-netflix-speed/"><u>In 2024, Optimize Your Viewing Experience Adjust Netflix Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/pioneers-in-online-mastery-meet-up/"><u>Pioneers in Online Mastery Meet-Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/sourav-joshis-roadmap-to-financial-freedom-via-youtube/"><u>Sourav Joshi's Roadmap to Financial Freedom via YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-future-unveiled-chatgpt-versus-astrological-prophecies/"><u>The Future Unveiled: ChatGPT Versus Astrological Prophecies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/unlocking-youtube-videos-a-guide-to-sequential-viewing/"><u>Unlocking YouTube Videos A Guide to Sequential Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-distinction-strong-artificial-intelligence-vs-weak-ai-explained/"><u>Unveiling the Distinction: Strong Artificial Intelligence Vs.

The pandemic has accelerated its growth. But what made it so special? Watching live streams is different from watching regular videos. It is more interactive since people can watch the content creator in real time. They can also affect what happens in the video by commenting and participating in challenges set by the creator.</p><p>That said, live streaming helps build a better connection between content creators and their audiences.

The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg"                      alt="programs and options for dailymotion monetization"                ></p><h3 id="Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1"><a href="#Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential"></a>Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential</h3><p>YouTube’s YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising.

Let’s dive into some key questions if you’re still not sure ( you can use both platforms ):</p><ul><li>Do you have a specific group in mind? It’s important to think about who your audience is.</li><li>Are Your Videos Targeted? Do your videos match specific search queries?</li><li>Video Length and Size: How long and big are your videos?</li><li>Monetization: Want to make money? Consider your subscriber count.</li><li>Privacy Control: How much control do you need over your content’s privacy?</li><li>Analytics: Do you want detailed data on your video performance?</li></ul><p>YouTube is your best bet if you want organic search traffic, a wide audience, and hefty videos. If you want privacy control, or if you want to monetize, Dailymotion shines.</p><p>Whatever you pick, remember to add captions to your videos. Transcription tools can help with that, making your content more accessible and engaging.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Enhance-Your-Monetization-Journey-with-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Video-Editing-Solution-1"><a href="#Part-3-Enhance-Your-Monetization-Journey-with-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Video-Editing-Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.</p><h4 id="Top-Intro-Sites-3"><a href="#Top-Intro-Sites-3" class="headerlink" title="Top Intro Sites"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Intro Sites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo.

Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-YouTube-Videos-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro</h4><p>That’s the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Synchronize clips in FCP "                ></p><ul><li>Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on <strong>Balance Color</strong> and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="adjust youtube video scale and position"                ></p><ul><li>You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.</li></ul><h4 id="Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly"><a href="#Step-3-Upload-to-YouTube-from-the-software-directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly"></a>Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Upload video to YouTube from FCP"                ></p><p>This one is rather easy.

Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -&gt; Publish and the entire thing is done.

Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you’ve left it over from some past event that’s long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it’s a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it’s not highlighted or you aren’t able to select it, the software doesn’t support it, and it’s not compatible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg"                      alt="Import YouTube videos in FCP "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files.

There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.</p><ul><li>First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound.

They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable-3"><a href="#2-Biteable-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest-3"><a href="#4-Renderforest-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list.

Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen.

If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the <strong>Google Meet live stream</strong> on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube"></a>Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube</h2><p>Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube.

To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to “Apps” and access the “Google Workspace” option.</p><p>Step2 Afterward, click “Google Meet” and tap on the “Stream” option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session.

Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen.

Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet</h3><p>Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming.

Check the following steps to execute the process:</p><p>Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to “Apps” and access the “Google Workspace” option.</p><p>Step2 Afterward, click “Google Meet” and tap on the “Stream” option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the “Stop Streaming” button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream"></a>Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream</h2><p>Do you want to save your <strong>Google Meet live-stream session</strong>?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Common-Issues-with-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Common-Issues-with-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Common Issues with YouTube Shorts Thumbnails"></a>Common Issues with YouTube Shorts Thumbnails</h2><p>Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel’s YouTube Studio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG"                      alt="opening youtube studio on computer"                ></p><ul><li>On the left navigation menu, click “Content.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG"                      alt="content section on youtube studio"                ></p><ul><li>Click the “pencil” icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.</li><li>Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click “Create Thumbnail.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-5.JPG"                      alt="changing shorts thumbnail on youtube studio"                ></p><h2 id="Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing"><a href="#Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?"></a>Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG"                      alt="fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.
