    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Systematic-Guide-Unearthing-YouTube’s-Concealed-Content"><a href="#Systematic-Guide-Unearthing-YouTube’s-Concealed-Content" class="headerlink" title="Systematic Guide: Unearthing YouTube’s Concealed Content"></a>Systematic Guide: Unearthing YouTube’s Concealed Content</h2><p>You may have noticed that some videos in your YouTube playlist are unavailable. This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.</p><p>To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to, we’ve compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We’ve also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Types of Videos on YouTube"></a>4 Types of Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

You are telling them about yourself, but you are doing it for their benefit. Address them directly (i.e. ‘If you like…’ or ‘you don’t want to miss’.) and make everything you say about them.

You are at your best when you let people see how much you care about something, so show your viewers how much you care about delivering great video content.

Instead of saying you make videos about makeup, say you make look tutorials and talk about your favorite styles. Instead of saying you are a gamer, tell your potential subscribers what games you post about and what some of your favorites are.</p><p>A specific schedule is important for getting people to subscribe. Generally, viewers do not subscribe to channels that have not posted in a long time. They subscribe because they do not want to miss out on new content, and if you follow a schedule, they will trust that that new content is on its way.</p><h4 id="Ask-Them-to-Subscribe"><a href="#Ask-Them-to-Subscribe" class="headerlink" title="Ask Them to Subscribe"></a>Ask Them to Subscribe</h4><p>Do not forget to ask the person to view your trailer to subscribe.</p><p>A lot of people go into YouTube thinking people will subscribe if they like their videos, and so making great videos is the only way to get people to subscribe. This is not true.</p><p>Making great videos is the first step to getting subscribers, but the second step is to ask for them. Not everyone subscribes to every channel they visit and enjoy. A person who enjoys your videos is more likely to subscribe if you prompt them to.</p><h4 id="30-Seconds"><a href="#30-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="30 Seconds"></a>30 Seconds</h4><p>The ideal length for a YouTube channel trailer is 30 seconds, or between 30 seconds and 1 minute.</p><p>The people viewing your trailer did not come to YouTube for the purpose of watching it. They are unlikely to give it much time before they continue browsing. This means you need to grab their attention tightly right away, but it also means you need to keep your trailer bite-sized.</p><p>Thirty seconds should be long enough to tell people what your channel is about, show off your personality, and ask them to subscribe. If you take much longer, viewers will click away before they hear your full pitch.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Here are a few simple steps to setting up your channel trailer.</p><ol><li>Turn on channel customization.

But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1.

YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform.

Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video. Also, adding effects and filters on the video using an editor like Wondershare Filmora can help.</p><p>Users can subscribe to Shorts channels. And if they see that your videos are well-edited and high-quality, they’ll be more likely to do so.

Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.</p><h2 id="Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal-1"><a href="#Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal-1" class="headerlink" title="Q7.

Some even go so far to compare <strong>IGTV to YouTube</strong>, currently, the largest video sharing platform in the world that hosts 300 minutes of video each minute. IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes. So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization"><a href="#4-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality. A good video editing software like Filmora can help you acheive this goal.</p><p><strong>Useful Features of Filmora</strong></p><ul><li>Cokor Matching: Apply color correction setting to multiple clips on one-click.</li><li>Effects: Create blockbuster videos with preset effects.</li><li>Motion Tracking: Track moving items and add elements to it at ease.</li><li>And more waiting for you to discover.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>IGTV receives quite a lot of attention from marketers and content creators alike.

So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference-1"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference-1" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-1"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-1" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences-1"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process-1"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content-1"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization-1"><a href="#4-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights-1"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes-1"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality.

Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content-3"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization-3"><a href="#4-Monetization-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights-3"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes-3"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality. A good video editing software like Filmora can help you acheive this goal.</p><p><strong>Useful Features of Filmora</strong></p><ul><li>Cokor Matching: Apply color correction setting to multiple clips on one-click.</li><li>Effects: Create blockbuster videos with preset effects.</li><li>Motion Tracking: Track moving items and add elements to it at ease.</li><li>And more waiting for you to discover.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Ultimate-Blueprint-for-Successful-FreeFire-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Blueprint-for-Successful-FreeFire-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Blueprint for Successful FreeFire Videos on YouTube"></a>The Ultimate Blueprint for Successful FreeFire Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Are you a YouTube gaming streamer looking for the right hashtags for FreeFiree - a popular mobile game with millions of players worldwide?

When someone leaves a mean, negative comment on one of your videos it will likely affect you. It may make you angry, hurt your feelings, or just leave you baffled over how someone could come away from your video with out-of-the-blue opinion the hater has posted. ‘Do not feed the trolls’ is a mantra that can be hard to abide by. This article will explain why you should not engage trolls and how to talk to them if you find yourself doing it anyways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube"></a>How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube</h2><h4 id="1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll"><a href="#1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll" class="headerlink" title="1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?"></a>1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?</h4><p> The internet is full of trolls and if you continue making YouTube videos – especially videos that get a lot of views – then you are sure to be attacked by a few. Or, alternatively, a troll may attack your other viewers in the comments of your videos. It is extremely easy to be a troll and so there are a lot of them.</p><p> Most trolls are easy to spot. They leave comments designed to hurt you or make you angry, often using over-the-top offensive language. Not all trolls are so obvious, though. Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> If you have put a lot of work into your YouTube videos then it only makes sense that you have an emotional investment in them.

They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-New-Era-of-Creativity-Pinpointing-the-Best-10-Budget-Friendly-Video-Art-Communities-on-YouTube"><a href="#A-New-Era-of-Creativity-Pinpointing-the-Best-10-Budget-Friendly-Video-Art-Communities-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="A New Era of Creativity: Pinpointing the Best 10 Budget-Friendly Video Art Communities on YouTube"></a>A New Era of Creativity: Pinpointing the Best 10 Budget-Friendly Video Art Communities on YouTube</h2><h1 id="10-Best-Free-YouTube-Channel-Art-Makers"><a href="#10-Best-Free-YouTube-Channel-Art-Makers" class="headerlink" title="10 Best Free YouTube Channel Art Makers"></a>10 Best Free YouTube Channel Art Makers</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-4"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-4" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>There are tons of free YouTube channel art makers online, so it’s easy for anyone to make their channel page look great without purchasing an expensive program like Photoshop.

While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort.

Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format.

However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources-3"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos-3"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these. The software basically tracks everything about your videos and presents them in a neatly organized dashboard, which is cuts the effort significantly for YouTube marketers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/se-ranking.jpg"                      alt="SE Ranking"                ></p><p>Do not leave the video by itself to garner views, it often fails to register any results because elements like the title, description and the keywords play an important role in getting the videos to the users.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Convert YouTube to MP4 Safely?

However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.

Firstly because it means you have to do all the work of shooting and editing every day and secondly because it means you need to have something to talk about every single day. Even vlogging once or twice a week is tough.</p><p>How do you know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what you should talk about in your vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for.

It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that.

Some people are so comfortable in front of the camera they can just turn it on and start talking about whatever’s on their mind, but they’re in the minority.</p><p>Before starting your daily vlogging, you have to figure out one important thing ahead of time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Do-you-have-a-niche-3"><a href="#Do-you-have-a-niche-3" class="headerlink" title="Do you have a niche?"></a>Do you have a niche?</h2><p>  You should have a niche. In a genre as broad as vlogging it is important to have some kind of hook that sets you apart from other vloggers. This can be an interest that you have, an industry you work in, or even a field of study you’re involved in at school. If you’re into technology, for example, you’ll always have a wealth of subjects to vlog about because all you’ll have to do is look at the day’s tech news and make a video reporting and commenting on it.</p><p>The other reason it’s good to have a niche is that you’ll be able to use keywords related to that niche in your video titles and tags. It’s hard to make it with a vlogging channel because nobody is searching for your content unless you are covering a specific topic like the technology they want to hear about.</p><ul><li><a href="#watching">What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</a></li><li><a href="#snapshots">Snapshots of Your Day</a></li><li><a href="#get-out">Whatever You Need to Get Out</a></li><li><a href="#learn">What did you learn today?</a></li></ul><p>Here are 4 things to talk about in your daily vlog:</p><h2 id="What-are-you-watching-reading-3"><a href="#What-are-you-watching-reading-3" class="headerlink" title="What are you watching&#x2F;reading?"></a>What are you watching&#x2F;reading?</h2><p> If you’re really into a book or tv show, or if you saw a movie recently, then those are all good things to talk about (warn people if you’re going to spoil anything!). You do recaps, reviews, or just share a few thoughts you had. If you’re worried about alienating people who don’t watch&#x2F;read the same stuff as you then you can keep it more general and just react to a few things from the media you’re consuming while also talking about your day. It’ll give you an anchor to build the rest of your video around, even if it’s not all you talk about.</p><p>By commenting on what you’re watching&#x2F;reading you have a better chance of capitalizing on a trending topic people are searching for. You could also find yourself an audience by becoming involved in fan communities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Snapshots-of-Your-Day-3"><a href="#Snapshots-of-Your-Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Snapshots of Your Day"></a>Snapshots of Your Day</h2><p> Casey Neistat is the master of this. He is always ready with a camera on hand so that, when something interesting happens, he can capture it and build his daily vlog around it.</p><p>Carrying a camera around like Casey may or may not suit your lifestyle, but you can still pick out one story from your day to tell. It doesn’t have to be a major event, and you shouldn’t worry that it won’t be interesting to other people. It’s your personality they’re tuning in for, so even if you’re just talking about a funny thing your cat did it will keep your audience interested because a) it’s you talking about it and b) it gives them a bit of insight into your life.</p><h2 id="Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out-2"><a href="#Whatever-You-Need-to-Get-Out-2" class="headerlink" title="Whatever You Need to Get Out"></a>Whatever You Need to Get Out</h2><p><em>Flula is frequently puzzled by English expressions, like ‘Party Pooper’, and needs to get his confusion off his chest at odd hours of the day.</em></p><p> Ranting about people you know can get messy when people from your offline life see it, so maybe avoid that. However, if you’re angry about something in general – or really happy about something – then whatever it is you’re feeling strongly about is probably the thing you should be vlogging about.</p><p>It does not matter what it is that is making you have this strong reaction (unless, again, it’s an actual person who might see your video and cause problems for you). If you’re mad about a real injustice in the world then that’s a great thing to talk about – you might even raise some awareness for the issue – but you can also rant about your favorite flavor of yogurt being cut and that’ll be engaging to viewers too.</p><p>Alternatively: you could do a vlog about how happy you are to have gotten engaged or a vlog about how happy you are that it was sunny today, and your enthusiasm will carry your audience through either video with you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-did-you-learn-today-3"><a href="#What-did-you-learn-today-3" class="headerlink" title="What did you learn today?"></a>What did you learn today?</h2><p> <em>Fun fact: The original lyrics Paul McCartney imagined for ‘Yesterday’ were ‘Scrambled eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs’.</em></p><p> You learn something new every day, right? Why not share that factoid with your viewers.

What did you have for breakfast, how was school&#x2F;work, did you talk to any friends, how was the weather – anything and everything. Generally, these videos can run a bit long and don’t have a lot of snappy editing. They’re faster to make, which is good if you’re doing them every day, but the unpolished nature of them won’t appeal to everyone. It will be exactly what appeals to some people, though.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img

With over 2 billion people trooping into the site monthly, making your brand come to the limelight in this social media implies reaching one-tenth of the users,i.e., if you play by the rules of strategically planning your business growth, the top. However, this article may not reveal the different strategies to adopt so you can become an influencer in your line of business; instead, it will start from scratch on how to get your YouTube business page started. How then can one create his own business YouTube account?</p><p><strong>1. Signing into a Google account</strong></p><p>To successfully start using the YouTube app, there is a need to sign officially into Google. If you’ve it in mind to have a separate Google account for your business account, you kick-start it at this stage.</p><p>However, you can still use your name to open a Google account and create a business YouTube account for subsequent use. The truth is that YouTube gives room for you still to make a <strong>business account</strong> with a business name thus, eliminating the need to use a business name in creating your Google account.</p><p><strong>2. Creating a business name</strong></p><p>Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the ‘create a channel’ icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select ‘Get started’ or ‘No thanks.’ A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-business-name-yt-channel-mobile.jpg"                      alt="create the business name"                ></p><p>Source: buffer.com</p><p>Selecting the custom name gives you the autonomy to use the brand or business name of your choice, after which you tap on the create option.</p><p><strong>3.

How then can one create his own business YouTube account?</p><p><strong>1. Signing into a Google account</strong></p><p>To successfully start using the YouTube app, there is a need to sign officially into Google. If you’ve it in mind to have a separate Google account for your business account, you kick-start it at this stage.</p><p>However, you can still use your name to open a Google account and create a business YouTube account for subsequent use.

Creating a business name</strong></p><p>Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the ‘create a channel’ icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select ‘Get started’ or ‘No thanks.’ A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-business-name-yt-channel-mobile.jpg"                      alt="create the business name"                ></p><p>Source: buffer.com</p><p>Selecting the custom name gives you the autonomy to use the brand or business name of your choice, after which you tap on the create option.</p><p><strong>3. Customize your business page</strong></p><p>At this point, you can design the layout by utilizing the appealing icon and banner of your choice, just as provided by the likes of Facebook or Twitter. The customized templates in Canva are there for you to design your page to your state.</p><p>I know you would be wondering how to go about this; YouTube can directly upload your artwork with a preview option available. You can crop your artwork to fit your page, making it look more professional.</p><p>To be emphatic, creating a business account is still simple but with professionalism. Remember you are selling yourself and your brand, and it is expedient to give your best on your page.

This will apply your privacy setting the second the video finishes uploading and processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-video-privacy.jpg"                      alt="upload youtube video privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p><p> To change the privacy setting later, go to Creator Studio, then Video Manager. On the right-hand side you’ll see one of three icons: a world, a chain, and a lock. The world means <strong>“public”</strong>, the chain means <strong>“unlisted”</strong>, and the lock is for <strong>“private”</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://cowinaudio.pxf.io/c/5597632/1116855/13794" target="_top" id="1116855"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13794-1116855"                      border="0" alt="" width="767" height="285"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1116855/13794"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlisted-video.JPG"                      alt="youtube privacy settings"                ></p><p> To change the privacy, click the icon.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-1"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-2"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some.

Discoverability"></a><strong>1. Discoverability</strong></h4><p>Having a niche differentiates your channel from all the other ones on YouTube. There is no denying the crowded space on the video platform. Every minute, <a class="link"   href="https://merchdope.com/youtube-statistics/" >300 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If you were simply copying other YouTubers, it will be challenging to grow, as your content will be in the shadows of all the other ones.</p><h4 id="2-Consistency"><a href="#2-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistency"></a><strong>2. Consistency</strong></h4><p>By having a consistent niche, your channel will be more coherent for those who discovered your awesome content and wants more related videos. If you don’t have a clear focus on your YouTube channel, it will be confusing for your potential fans.</p><p>For example, if you created a great video about painting, but your channel also contains videos with you playing video games, doing movie commentaries, and cooking recipes, then the viewer who discovered your painting video wouldn’t subscribe to you because she has no interest in the other topics your channel covers.</p><h4 id="3-Credibility"><a href="#3-Credibility" class="headerlink" title="3. Credibility"></a><strong>3. Credibility</strong></h4><p>In a specialized niche, you can own it and become an expert on the topic. Increasing your credibility will allow you to build trust much faster with your audience and therefore, grow at a much faster rate.</p><h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche on YouTube"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche on YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-Is-Your-Objective-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What Is Your Objective On YouTube?"></a><strong>What Is Your Objective On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>Do you want to make money? Do you want to fuel a passion? Do you want to educate the masses?</p><p>Your intentions on YouTube can be a numbers game: you want to get views, subscribers, and make money.</p><p>Or perhaps your intentions on YouTube can be to make content for a specific audience so that you can build a community.</p><p>Moreover, you might be using YouTube as the platform to showcase your personal brand and develop a reputation that you can bring to the real world.</p><p>Once you have a clear objective for what you want to achieve on YouTube, then you can consider the tactical direction to take your channel in: finding a niche and creating content for it.</p><h4 id="What-is-Your-Passion"><a href="#What-is-Your-Passion" class="headerlink" title="What is Your Passion?"></a><strong>What is Your Passion?</strong></h4><p>Building a YouTube channel is a grind and if you are not passionate about the topics you are covering in your niche, you may not have the motivation needed to churn out videos day after day, week after week.</p><p>Answering what you are passionate about isn’t enough to form your niche around, but it is definitely a critical part. <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-your-passion.html" >Start by finding your passion. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Think of the things that you can do for hours without getting bored. Think of the hobbies you have where you put in hours and hours to improve. Think about all the research you’ve done on a given topic for no other reason than satisfying your own curiosity. These can all help you understand what you are most passionate about.</p><p>Knowing your passion opens an avenue for you to travel down in discovering your niche. But the journey isn’t over yet… there are few more questions to ask:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Expertises"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Expertises" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Expertises?"></a><strong>What Are Your Expertises?</strong></h4><p>Over the course of your life, you have gained experiences and skills — and you might not even know it. Stop for a moment and take inventory of everything that you feel you know better than the average person.</p><p>While the term “expert” is subjective, consider this, what can you pick up and do without a guide or a manual, or what can you tell me without Googling or researching?</p><p>If you can sit at a piano and start playing beautiful music, you have expertise in it. If you can tell me off the top of your head what train and bus to take to get across town, you are an expert in your city. Your expertise is what you confidently know.</p><h4 id="What-Do-People-Know-You-For"><a href="#What-Do-People-Know-You-For" class="headerlink" title="What Do People Know You For?"></a><strong>What Do People Know You For?</strong></h4><p>If you are having trouble finding your expertise, ask those who are close to you: What am I best known for?</p><p>If your friends tell you that you are known for being athletic, then that might be an area to explore. If your classmates tell you that you are always punctual, you might be an expert in time management.</p><p>Sometimes it takes someone else to tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are.</p><p>Once you’ve recognized what you are an expert on, you can expand on it.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions about your expertise:</p><p>- Can I teach people what I know?</p><p>- Will I want to learn more about this topic?</p><p>- Does this knowledge solve problems or improve life?</p><p>Once answered, you are that much closer to identifying your niche. But there is still another major question:</p><h4 id="What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs"><a href="#What-Are-Your-Audience’s-Wants-and-Needs" class="headerlink" title="What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?"></a><strong>What Are Your Audience’s Wants and Needs?</strong></h4><p>If you are passionate about and an expert on a topic, but the topic is not interesting or useful to anyone then you are going to have a tough time getting views on YouTube.</p><p>When it comes down to it, your content needs to do at least 1 of 3 things, but if you strive to have all 3, you’ll have the recipe for a successful video:</p><p>- Educate</p><p>- Entertain</p><p>- Inspire</p><h4 id="Educate-Your-Audience"><a href="#Educate-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Educate Your Audience"></a><strong>Educate Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to learn how to solve a problem or answer a question. If your content can teach, it will be valuable because it has real-world applications.

YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf.

Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3.

Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done.

How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video. Also, adding effects and filters on the video using an editor like Wondershare Filmora can help.</p><p>Users can subscribe to Shorts channels. And if they see that your videos are well-edited and high-quality, they’ll be more likely to do so. Once they are subscribed, they will see and watch your videos more often.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back.

The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video. Also, adding effects and filters on the video using an editor like Wondershare Filmora can help.</p><p>Users can subscribe to Shorts channels. And if they see that your videos are well-edited and high-quality, they’ll be more likely to do so. Once they are subscribed, they will see and watch your videos more often.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

If you don’t know what a green screen is and how it works, check out the video tutorial below to get an overall idea first:</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>In fact, nowadays, green screen is actually well within the capabilities and budget of people like you and I.
