YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube’s community.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?"></a>How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?</h3><p><strong>Compatability:</strong> Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn’t be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don’t have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don’t show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there’s no reason investing in it if you don’t have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam’s audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can’t afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.</p><p><strong>Adjustable Location:</strong> Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h3 id="4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021"><a href="#4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021"></a>4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021</h3><p>There are thousands of different webcams you can use to record a live stream, but the models featured below are some of the very best currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam"><a href="#1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021-3"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams.

Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.</p><p>Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?</h2><p>An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.</p><p>Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.</p><p>You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.</p><p>Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape"                ></p><p>The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.</p><p>Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract"                ></p><p>Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.</p><p>You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab.

When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.</p><p>Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing"                ></p><p>Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu. Change the Blending Mode to Multiply, and the text in the overlaying video should be filled with the parts of the footage from the video below it.</p><p>Optionally you can enhance the colors in the background video or adjust the size of the text before exporting your project from Filmora.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are so many different ways to create visually striking content, and adding videos to text is just one among numerous techniques that enable you to make a PowerPoint presentation or an opening of a video more interesting to watch.</p><p>Merging text with video is equally easy in PowerPoint and Filmora, so you just have to choose which software better suits your needs and select the materials that fit the style of your project.

These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.</p><p>As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting. The content might be good, but it won’t help you grow.</p><h2 id="2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche-2"><a href="#2-Find-Trending-Topics-Within-Your-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”.

This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below.

This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="-6"><a href="#-6" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL-3"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt=" Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-7"><a href="#-7" class="headerlink" title=""></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-3"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

And the green screen is one common practice. Green screen technology is a technique where you use two images or video streams to composite them together. You can use any background images, either foreground or behind the actors. For YouTube, you can use green screen subscribe to facilitate video Call To Action. A green screen easily produces impossible scenes and expands filming ideas. Everything done at the Studio is also the best way to protect actors from hazardous environments.</p><p>More so, the best trick is to allow actors to appear together on the screen even when the scenes were captured separately. And did you know that subscribe green screen makes it easy to add YouTube Call To Action and direct viewers on what to do?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-1.png"                      alt="subscribe green screen"                ></p><h2 id="Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video"><a href="#Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Methods to add a subscribe button to your video"></a>Methods to add a subscribe button to your video</h2><p>Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.</p><h4 id="1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Use-Subscribe-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1 Use Subscribe Green Screen"></a>1 Use Subscribe Green Screen</h4><p>Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Set screen</strong><br>You need to create a background at the Studio – and that’s the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png"                      alt="how to make subscribe green screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Adjust lighting</strong><br>Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up the subject</strong><br>Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn’t professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png"                      alt="make your own green screen - set up the object"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Start filming</strong><br>Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.</p><p><strong>Step 5. Polish the rough cut</strong><br>Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.</p><p><strong>Step 6. Key out the footage and edit the green screen</strong><br>Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.</p><p><strong>Step 7. Paste the new background</strong><br>Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.</p><p><strong>Step 8. Add Call To Action</strong><br>Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren’t yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.</p><h4 id="2-Using-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#2-Using-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="2 Using YouTube Studio"></a>2 Using YouTube Studio</h4><p>You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. First, go directly to “studio.youtube.com” or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-5.png"                      alt="add subscirbe button using youtube studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Click on the “Menu” option and choose the “Settings”&gt; “Channel” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-6.png"                      alt="add subscirbe button using youtube studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Then select the “Choose” image and select which subscribe button image you wish to use as your branding watermark. You can easily get one on the Google images section.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Next, choose the display time for the branding watermark. It could be a custom start time if you want the branding watermark to start showing at a specific time. You can also choose “End or video” for it to appear at the last 10 to 15 seconds of your video. Likewise, the branding watermark can show throughout the video if you choose the “Entire video” option.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Finally, save the changes. Voila! Viewers can subscribe to your channel easily, with a single click of a button.</p><h4 id="3-Using-Subscribe-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Subscribe-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3 Using Subscribe Effects"></a>3 Using Subscribe Effects</h4><p>You can also use the subscribers’ effects to add a Call To Action. Remember, your main aim is to increase the audience to your channel. And in most cases, viewers forget to subscribe even though they love your video. Perhaps they don’t understand the importance it holds to your channel. You can do this using a reliable video editor software – Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is a sophisticated tool that is easy to use and export your videos to your computer and upload them to YouTube. It has over 300 effects for YouTubers and comprises exclusive overlays for any scene. Follow these steps to add the subscribe button with subscribe effects.</p><h5 id="Key-Features-of-Filmora"><a href="#Key-Features-of-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Key Features of Filmora"></a>Key Features of Filmora</h5><ul><li>Edit and export your videos at up to 4K resolution</li><li>Supports GIF animation, which you can use for CTA</li><li>It has an advanced text editor</li><li>Easily remove background noise for a polished video sound</li><li>It has an audio equalizer functionality for audio uniformity</li><li>It has the video stabilization functionality</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Launch Filmora<br>Open Filmora on your computer, then navigate to the upper left corner of the screen.

And did you know that subscribe green screen makes it easy to add YouTube Call To Action and direct viewers on what to do?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-1.png"                      alt="subscribe green screen"                ></p><h2 id="Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video-3"><a href="#Methods-to-add-a-subscribe-button-to-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Methods to add a subscribe button to your video"></a>Methods to add a subscribe button to your video</h2><p>Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided.

It’s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you. Not great if there is a lot of action in your videos.</p><h4 id="TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99"><a href="#TONOR-PC-Microphone-Computer-Condenser-15-99" class="headerlink" title="TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99"></a><strong>TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TONOR-Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B01142EPO4/" >TONOR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is an easy-to-setup condenser microphone that you can connect to your computer via USB and start recording in seconds.</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser.jpg"                      alt="tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser"                ></strong></p><p> <strong>Pro:</strong> The value of this microphone is in its ease of use. With a flexible, foldable stand, you can adjust the TONOR PC microphone the way it suits your setup. The legs of the stand are retractable, which makes it easy for you to store. If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it won’t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras.

It doesn’t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.</p><h4 id="Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73"><a href="#Samson-Go-Mic-Portable-USB-Condenser-Microphone-37-73" class="headerlink" title="Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73"></a><strong>Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42" >Samson Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg"                      alt="samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.</p><p>It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.</p><h4 id="XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99"><a href="#XIAOKOA-Mini-Condenser-Microphone-with-Stand-24-99" class="headerlink" title="XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99"></a><strong>XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99</strong></h4><p>The<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/" >XIAOKOA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg"                      alt="xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video.

The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera.

That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored" class="headerlink" title="2.

Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers.

What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos.

In other words, it’s the last part of a video with calls to action links.</p><p>One of the most effective technical methods of optimizing YouTube videos is by adding an outro. This helps attract huge traffic, increase conversion and engage viewers.</p><p>Why spend your time adding outro? You can add Outro to YouTube videos to direct viewers to your website, other selected videos, engage viewers for longer and to persuade them to subscribe to the channel. In short, most end screens have four elements incorporated into an outro: Channel, subscribe, Video playlist and a website link.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro"><a href="#Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro"></a>Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro</h2><p>Most YouTube videos have an intro and an outro. In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical. For your videos to achieve meaningful results, it’s important to view each as distinct from the other. Equally important to know, both intros and outros have different purposes.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Differences Between YouTube Intro And Outro</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intro</td><td>Outro</td></tr><tr><td>Inserted at the begging of a video</td><td>Inserted at the end of a video</td></tr><tr><td>Used to capture audience attention</td><td>Directs the audience to the next step</td></tr><tr><td>Introduces the topic</td><td>Suggests new topics to viewers</td></tr><tr><td>Attract viewers to the video</td><td>Contains a call-action button</td></tr><tr><td>Showcases a brand, logo, business slogan or a statement mission</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements"><a href="#Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements"></a>Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements</h2><p>Just as their requirements for any video uploaded on YouTube, outros are no exception. For your outro to be interactive, observe the following requirements:</p><p><strong>1. Outro Resolution</strong></p><p>Outros for YouTube should have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a resolution of 1920px X 1080px.</p><p><strong>2. Outro Element Sizes and Dimensions</strong></p><p>End screen templates comprise elements that are in different shapes and sizes. When using a YouTube outro size of 1920px X 1080px, here are the element dimensions to use:</p><ul><li>Subscribe – 294px X 294px</li><li>Channel – 294px X 294px</li><li>Website link - 294px X 294px</li><li>Video playlist – 615px X 345px</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="youtube outro screen format"                ></p><p><strong>3. Outro Length</strong></p><p>If you want to make your outro boring, make it long. So, how long should YouTube outro be? For your outros to have a high conversation rate, they should be approximately 10-20 seconds long. However, the length of your video should be the determining factor. A one-hour YouTube video can have a longer outro.</p><p>Don’t be challenged by setting the above sizes because nearly all intro and outro makers have already set dimensions for the elements. The major requirements are done for you</p><h2 id="Section-4-Best-Practices-When-Making-A-YouTube-Outro"><a href="#Section-4-Best-Practices-When-Making-A-YouTube-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Section 4: Best Practices When Making A YouTube Outro"></a>Section 4: Best Practices When Making A YouTube Outro</h2><p>Imagine given 10 seconds to showcase your YouTube channel and direct viewers on the next move without breaking the engagement!

Each YouTube outro element should have its own goal.</p><ol><li><strong>Simple, clear and easy to interpret</strong></li></ol><p>Your outro will be meaningless if the audience cannot take action due to the complexity of either the language used or the ambiguity of words used.

In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical.

In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical.

You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’.

They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option!

The RØDE Video Shotgun Mic is only $140. You will not be able to stray far from your camera as it works best when you are close to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment06.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>MP3 Recorder:</strong> A very high quality voice recorder is one way to record great audio and still be able to move freely.

This is a more expensive option. The Sony LAV Wireless Mic System is $600.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>Free Option!

If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

Objects that are closer to the lens appear much bigger while objects that are further away appear even smaller. Perspectives are also enhanced, making close objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame appear more stretched out. Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, wide-angle lenses will appear the least zoomed in.</p><h4 id="Standard-Lens"><a href="#Standard-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Standard Lens"></a>Standard Lens</h4><p>With standard lenses or normal lenses, you won’t get the stretched out objects or enhanced perspectives that you get from wide-angle lenses. Instead, standard lenses are meant to see scenes as the natural human eye is meant to see them. If you shoot a scene with both a wide-angle lens and a standard lens from the same position, you’ll notice that less of the scene fits into your frame. Standard lenses will appear more zoomed-in than wide-angle lenses, but less zoomed-in than telephoto lenses.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-Lens"><a href="#Telephoto-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto Lens"></a>Telephoto Lens</h4><p>Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, telephoto lenses will appear the most zoomed in. This can be beneficial for the shooter who wants to get a closer shot of a scene without having to physically be in close proximity to the scene. Objects that are further away in the background also appear larger and closer than they would appear on wide-angle or standard lenses.</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group"><a href="#Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group"></a>Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group</h3><p>You can get your talking head footage using lenses from any of the three focal length groups. Depending on how you plan to vlog most of the time, though, one of the three focal lengths might be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a wide-angle lens"></a>When to vlog with a wide-angle lens</h4><p>Wide-angle lenses are the most commonly used lenses for vlogging. Wide-angle lenses are great when you need to be close to your camera. This might be the case for you if your recording space is small or if you want to film yourself as you hold your camera up with your own hand.</p><p>Being close to your camera not only gives you the option to use your camera’s built-in microphone, but it also gives you the option to make use of camera-mounted shotgun microphones.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a standard lens"></a>When to vlog with a standard lens</h4><p>Standard lenses are great when you have more space to be further away from your camera. The perspectives in your shot will look more natural through a standard lens, making your talking head footage feel more corporate or professional. You’ll also be able to get blurrier backgrounds using a standard lens versus a wide-angle lens.</p><p>Being further away from your camera, however, means that you’ll have to use a separate microphone positioned closer to you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a telephoto lens"></a>When to vlog with a telephoto lens</h4><p>As telephoto lenses are even more zoomed in, you’ll need to be even further away from your camera to fit yourself inside your camera frame. Why would any vlogger ever need to be that far away from their camera? One word… teleprompter. If you want or need to stick to a script, you’ll have to be far away enough from your camera that it doesn’t appear like your eyes are scanning left to right. You then close in the distance with a telephoto lens.</p><p>  In the above video, Marcos Rocha compares different focal lengths for talking head videos. Which focal length range do you like the look of?</p><h3 id="Crop-Factor"><a href="#Crop-Factor" class="headerlink" title="Crop Factor"></a>Crop Factor</h3><p>Focal lengths in camera lenses are measured in millimeters. You can vlog yourself handheld with a 24mm lens on a camera with a full-frame sensor (the sensor is the piece of hardware inside your camera that turns the light it receives into a digital image). But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4&#x2F;3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg"                      alt="Crop Factor"                ></p><p> In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.</p><h3 id="Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table"><a href="#Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table" class="headerlink" title="Focal Length Equivalency Table"></a>Focal Length Equivalency Table</h3><p>This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4&#x2F;3 camera.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Focal Length &#x2F; Sensor</th><th>Full Frame</th><th>APS-C</th><th>Micro 4&#x2F;3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>16mm</td><td>10mm</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>18mm</td><td>11mm</td><td>9mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>24mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>12mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide</td><td>35mm</td><td>22mm</td><td>18mm</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>50mm</td><td>31mm</td><td>25mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>70mm</td><td>44mm</td><td>35mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>100mm</td><td>63mm</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>200mm</td><td>125mm</td><td>100mm</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Aperture"><a href="#Aperture" class="headerlink" title="Aperture"></a>Aperture</h3><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture"                ></p><p> The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f&#x2F;1.4, f&#x2F;1.8, f&#x2F;2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture Range"                ></p><p> Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.</p><p>Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.</p><p>But do you even need a fast lens?</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h3><h4 id="Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>Better low-light performance</li><li>Better autofocus performance</li><li>Better “bokeh” (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>More expensive</li><li>Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture</li><li>Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture</li></ul><h3 id="Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).</p><p>OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.</p><p>  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.</p><p>If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.</p><p> Looking for ways to set up your talking-head shot for YouTube with any of these lenses?

But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4&#x2F;3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg"                      alt="Crop Factor"                ></p><p> In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.</p><h3 id="Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table-3"><a href="#Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table-3" class="headerlink" title="Focal Length Equivalency Table"></a>Focal Length Equivalency Table</h3><p>This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4&#x2F;3 camera.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Focal Length &#x2F; Sensor</th><th>Full Frame</th><th>APS-C</th><th>Micro 4&#x2F;3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>16mm</td><td>10mm</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>18mm</td><td>11mm</td><td>9mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>24mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>12mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide</td><td>35mm</td><td>22mm</td><td>18mm</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>50mm</td><td>31mm</td><td>25mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>70mm</td><td>44mm</td><td>35mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>100mm</td><td>63mm</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>200mm</td><td>125mm</td><td>100mm</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Aperture-3"><a href="#Aperture-3" class="headerlink" title="Aperture"></a>Aperture</h3><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture"                ></p><p> The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f&#x2F;1.4, f&#x2F;1.8, f&#x2F;2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture Range"                ></p><p> Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.</p><p>Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.</p><p>But do you even need a fast lens?</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3"><a href="#Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h3><h4 id="Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3"><a href="#Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>Better low-light performance</li><li>Better autofocus performance</li><li>Better “bokeh” (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3"><a href="#Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>More expensive</li><li>Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture</li><li>Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture</li></ul><h3 id="Optical-Image-Stabilization-3"><a href="#Optical-Image-Stabilization-3" class="headerlink" title="Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).</p><p>OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.</p><p>  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.</p><p>If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.</p><p> Looking for ways to set up your talking-head shot for YouTube with any of these lenses?

No matter how good the content of your video is if you are unable to convey that with the thumbnail of your video, it will not bring any good to your channel. If you are looking forward to growing your channel and attracting more viewers, then having an appealing and eye-catching thumbnail is one of the most important factors. There are several things to be considered while creating a custom thumbnail if you want to make your videos look stunning and engaging.

We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p><p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Show-your-face"><a href="#Show-your-face" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li></ol><p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size.

Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness.

Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-1"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements.

I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-2"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements.

Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-3"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence-3"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side-3"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side-3" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size.

It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-preview-wisely.gif"                      alt="choose-preview-wisely"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?"></a>How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?</h2><p>Many of you might be interested in how to make a fortnite thumbnail, so here it is.

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it.

Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio.

Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do" class="headerlink" title="2.

If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’.

Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do-3"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

What should I do?</h4><p>At the time of this writing, YouTube doesn’t allow anyone to post a comment on any video that has been set as ‘Private’. If your video is configured that way, you must change its nature to ‘Unlisted’, and share its link to the users before they can post a comment.</p><h4 id="3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments-3"><a href="#3-How-can-I-block-certain-words-and-links-on-the-YouTube-comments-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can add multiple words by separating them with commas. To block the comments with links, check the <strong>Block links</strong> box.

When you turn off the comments, the existing comments disappear.

If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?"></a>5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’. If the comments on any video were enabled previously, and are disabled later on, the existing comments automatically disappear. They reappear when the comments on the video are reenabled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Enhancing-YouTube-Visibility-with-TubeBuddy"><a href="#Enhancing-YouTube-Visibility-with-TubeBuddy" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing YouTube Visibility with TubeBuddy"></a>Enhancing YouTube Visibility with TubeBuddy</h2><h1 id="The-Benefits-of-TubeBuddy-Manage-Your-YouTube-Channel-More-Easily"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-TubeBuddy-Manage-Your-YouTube-Channel-More-Easily" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of TubeBuddy | Manage Your YouTube Channel More Easily"></a>The Benefits of TubeBuddy | Manage Your YouTube Channel More Easily</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Nov 01, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>TubeBuddy is a YouTube certified extension for your Google Chrome browser.

It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one).

To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views.

Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think?

However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies.

The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again.

Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career.

The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle.

There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention.

To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views.

While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee.

They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites.

At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options.

It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content.

Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-3"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-3" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-3" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-3" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-3" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think? Would you buy YouTube views, or can you get by growing your channel organically?</p><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Gain-More-Views-3"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Gain-More-Views-3"

More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><h3 id="c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts"><a href="#c-Try-Giveaways-and-gifts" class="headerlink" title="c. Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>! Till date, the video has over 14 million views</p><p>We do not advise you to try this out when you are just starting your YouTube career. Only venture out to such investments when you are stable when it comes to earnings.</p><h2 id="Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback"><a href="#Tip-3-Ask-your-audience-for-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback"></a><strong>Tip#3: Ask your audience for Feedback</strong></h2><p>All your videos must be created with the audience in mind. However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry.

Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers.

Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="4.

You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p><p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-1"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-1"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-2"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-2"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p><h4 id="3-People-Like-People-2"><a href="#3-People-Like-People-2" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p><p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p><p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition-2"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail-2"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail-2" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail-2"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-3"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-3"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p><h4 id="3-People-Like-People-3"><a href="#3-People-Like-People-3" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p><p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p><p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition-3"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p><p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p><p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p><h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-3"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p><p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"                ></p><p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p><h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p><p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="YouTube’s-Shorts-Thumbnail-Dilemnas-Quick-Fixes"><a href="#YouTube’s-Shorts-Thumbnail-Dilemnas-Quick-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Shorts Thumbnail Dilemnas &amp; Quick Fixes"></a>YouTube’s Shorts Thumbnail Dilemnas &amp; Quick Fixes</h2><p>Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel’s YouTube Studio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG"                      alt="opening youtube studio on computer"                ></p><ul><li>On the left navigation menu, click “Content.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG"                      alt="content section on youtube studio"                ></p><ul><li>Click the “pencil” icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.</li><li>Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click “Create Thumbnail.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-5.JPG"                      alt="changing shorts thumbnail on youtube studio"                ></p><h2 id="Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing"><a href="#Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?"></a>Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG"                      alt="fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back. Wondershare Filmora is available on mobile. And it’s one of the best tools for enhancing a short-form video.</p><p>Short-form video watchers love filters, transitions, and effects. And Filmora gives you access to all of that. It provides you with fun and amazing filters, effects, transitions, and stamps that can add a wow factor to your short-form video.</p><h2 id="Q6-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Make-Money"><a href="#Q6-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP. They made it easier for Shorts content creators to get into the program.</p><h2 id="Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal"><a href="#Q7-How-Do-You-Make-YouTube-Shorts-Play-Normal" class="headerlink" title="Q7.

So to attract viewers, you must leverage the things in your control. You must title your videos in a way that will make users click the video.

Necessary Elements of a YouTube Sports Channel</h2><p>If you want to start a YouTube sports channel, you need to keep in mind that sports videos are fundamentally different from other types of videos. This requires you to have a strong grasp not only on content but video editing as well. Here are some of the top elements that every YouTube sports channel needs.</p><h3 id="1-Insightful-Producer-Perspective"><a href="#1-Insightful-Producer-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="1.Insightful Producer Perspective"></a>1.Insightful Producer Perspective</h3><p>First of all, you should try to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the sport you are going to talk about on your channel. If you are just an amateur or a casual fan, you will need to do more preparation as a sports YouTuber.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/sport-channel-host.jpg"                      alt="sports channel host"                ></p><h3 id="2-Brief-and-Clear-Delivery"><a href="#2-Brief-and-Clear-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="2.Brief and Clear Delivery"></a>2.Brief and Clear Delivery</h3><p>The second most important thing is to communicate your perspective in an entertaining, brief, and interactive manner so your viewers remain engaged and keep coming back to your channel. If you fail to communicate properly, your viewers will go somewhere else to watch what they are looking for.</p><h3 id="3-Advanced-Video-Editing"><a href="#3-Advanced-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="3.Advanced Video Editing"></a>3.Advanced Video Editing</h3><p>Apart from the content, you need to make yourself familiar with using advanced video editing features such as picture-in-picture, screen recording, and audio recording.

Must Use Feature for Making a Sports YouTube Channel</h2><p>There are many features that you may need in your sports content creation. High video quality will bring more views and attract more fans to your YouTube channel. Here are some features you may use in making sports videos.</p><h3 id="1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording"><a href="#1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording"></a>1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording</h3><p>One of the top features that you must use in your sports content creation is screen recording. It is a vital feature for all sports YouTubers and it is used extensively for multiple reasons:</p><ul><li>It gives content creators the ability to give demonstrations in a clear and convenient manner that is easily understandable.</li><li>Screen recording also allows them to create how-to and tutorial videos for games and other sports.</li><li>They can also use this feature to record a video clip that may not be easy to include in the final video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube"                ></p><p>This feature will give your audience the opportunity to understand your point clearly without having to visualize everything in their heads.

Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture"></a>2. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture</h3><p>Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Picture in Picture allows you to stay visible to your audience while commentating or giving your opinion on a game.</li><li>It also provides you with the ability to divert more focus on the game so the bigger part of the screen is dedicated to sports.</li><li>You can also switch between the smaller and bigger video sections when necessary, for example during a break or interval.</li><li>It gives you the opportunity to make your YouTube channel more personalized with your own take on picture-in-picture.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/pip.jpg"                      alt="pip"                ></p><p>Picture in picture is a great feature for sports YouTubers on Mac as it keeps the video entertaining and personalized. Without using a picture-in-picture feature, you will find it difficult to compete with other sports YouTube channels.</p><h3 id="3-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Audio-Recording"><a href="#3-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Audio-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording"></a>3. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording</h3><p>There are times when you cannot use the native audio of the sports video and need to add your own. It means that you need to record your own audio file and add it to the video before uploading it to your YouTube channel. This feature allows you to:</p><ul><li>Edit the audio of your sports video to make it more customizable according to your target audience.</li><li>Remove the audio that might cause copyright issues and add your own to ensure your content remains original.</li><li>Add your own remarks, commentary, and opinions in the video in full or in parts to make it more engaging and interactive.</li><li>Make videos where you just need background music and don’t need the original audio such as montages, tributes, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-record-voiceover.jpg"                      alt="voiceover"                ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Clear and crisp audio recording is necessary to ensure that the video you upload on your sports YouTube channel is of high quality.

Must Use Feature for Making a Sports YouTube Channel</h2><p>There are many features that you may need in your sports content creation. High video quality will bring more views and attract more fans to your YouTube channel. Here are some features you may use in making sports videos.</p><h3 id="1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording-1"><a href="#1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording"></a>1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording</h3><p>One of the top features that you must use in your sports content creation is screen recording. It is a vital feature for all sports YouTubers and it is used extensively for multiple reasons:</p><ul><li>It gives content creators the ability to give demonstrations in a clear and convenient manner that is easily understandable.</li><li>Screen recording also allows them to create how-to and tutorial videos for games and other sports.</li><li>They can also use this feature to record a video clip that may not be easy to include in the final video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube"                ></p><p>This feature will give your audience the opportunity to understand your point clearly without having to visualize everything in their heads.

Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture"></a>2. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture</h3><p>Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Picture in Picture allows you to stay visible to your audience while commentating or giving your opinion on a game.</li><li>It also provides you with the ability to divert more focus on the game so the bigger part of the screen is dedicated to sports.</li><li>You can also switch between the smaller and bigger video sections when necessary, for example during a break or interval.</li><li>It gives you the opportunity to make your YouTube channel more personalized with your own take on picture-in-picture.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/pip.jpg"                      alt="pip"                ></p><p>Picture in picture is a great feature for sports YouTubers on Mac as it keeps the video entertaining and personalized.

Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording</h3><p>There are times when you cannot use the native audio of the sports video and need to add your own. It means that you need to record your own audio file and add it to the video before uploading it to your YouTube channel. This feature allows you to:</p><ul><li>Edit the audio of your sports video to make it more customizable according to your target audience.</li><li>Remove the audio that might cause copyright issues and add your own to ensure your content remains original.</li><li>Add your own remarks, commentary, and opinions in the video in full or in parts to make it more engaging and interactive.</li><li>Make videos where you just need background music and don’t need the original audio such as montages, tributes, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-record-voiceover.jpg"                      alt="voiceover"                ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Clear and crisp audio recording is necessary to ensure that the video you upload on your sports YouTube channel is of high quality.
