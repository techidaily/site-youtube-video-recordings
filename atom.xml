Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do" class="headerlink" title="2.

If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’.

Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?"></a>1. Why can’t I comment on the YouTube video?</h4><p>There could be several reasons for this. For instance, the video or the entire channel is configured as ‘Made for kids’ by the owner, comments are disabled for the video or the channel by the owner, you are using some inappropriate words in the comment that have been temporarily blocked by YouTube, and the text requires to be reviewed and approved by the owner before it becomes visible, etc.</p><h4 id="2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do-3"><a href="#2-I-want-people-to-comment-on-my-Private-video-What-should-I-do-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can add multiple words by separating them with commas. To block the comments with links, check the <strong>Block links</strong> box.

If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?"></a>5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’. If the comments on any video were enabled previously, and are disabled later on, the existing comments automatically disappear. They reappear when the comments on the video are reenabled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Instantaneous-Subscriber-Tracking"><a href="#Instantaneous-Subscriber-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Instantaneous Subscriber Tracking"></a>Instantaneous Subscriber Tracking</h2><h1 id="Top-12-Real-time-YouTube-Subscriber-Trackers"><a href="#Top-12-Real-time-YouTube-Subscriber-Trackers" class="headerlink" title="Top 12 Real-time YouTube Subscriber Trackers"></a>Top 12 Real-time YouTube Subscriber Trackers</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>There are many components that are important for the success of your YouTube channel, but none of them are as <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >important as subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Your subscriber count will tell you how well your channel is doing.

That’s why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are.

The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor.

The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera’s 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second.

With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor.

With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor.

The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn’t provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D’s 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400</em> <em>- Amazing touchscreen controls</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video recording option</em> <em>- No USB 3.0</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Dance-Directives-Finding-Ideal-DJ-Templates"><a href="#Dance-Directives-Finding-Ideal-DJ-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Dance Directives: Finding Ideal DJ Templates"></a>Dance Directives: Finding Ideal DJ Templates</h2><p>Most think music is the most important thing in a professional DJ set.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others.

It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download. Remember what you learned here, and make sure you use the tools we suggested to find the best templates.

The app offers support for videos in 1080p, 2K, or 4K resolution, which means that you watch high-quality videos from your phone.

However, if you log into your account on YouTube, with the OGYouTube app you won’t be able to download videos.

NewPipe collects the URL source from YouTube and displays the information it gathers in the app that is completely independent of this platform. The app’s users can search videos, view the video’s info, or choose which streaming player they are going to use to watch the video. The app offers support for videos in 1080p, 2K, or 4K resolution, which means that you watch high-quality videos from your phone. The NewPipe app is a great choice for YouTubers who don’t have powerful Android phones but still want to enjoy the benefits of browsing the world’s largest video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>NewPipe Features</strong></p><ul><li>Runs without Google Play Services</li><li>Unlimited downloads</li><li>You can set and change the quality of video play</li><li>Play videos in the background while you use other apps</li><li>Download the video and audio at different resolutions.</li><li>Play video as a Pop-up box for multitasking</li><li>Lightweight and consumes low storage and battery</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/" >Download New Pipe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/NewPipe-youtube-alternative-android.jpg"                      alt="NewPipe YouTube Alternative "                ></p><h5 id="Pros-35"><a href="#Pros-35" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Great browsing and search features</p><p>Lets you download videos to your device</p><p>Offers support for high-resolution videos</p><h5 id="Cons-35"><a href="#Cons-35" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The app is not available on the Google Play store</p><p>Limited tools for creating playlists</p><h3 id="2-OGYouTube-3"><a href="#2-OGYouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

As a matter of fact, this app is just an older version of the YouTube client app, that still provides the option to download videos. However, if you log into your account on YouTube, with the OGYouTube app you won’t be able to download videos. The app’s interface is identical to YouTube’s interface, which means that you won’t have to waste a lot of time trying to figure out how to use OGYouTube.</p><p><strong>OGYouTube Features</strong></p><ul><li>Play and download videos directly from the app</li><li>Supports different video qualities</li><li>Play video in background</li><li>Comes with a dark mode on android devices</li><li>Runs parallel with the default YouTube app</li><li>No annoying ads to disturb you</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://ogyoutube.en.uptodown.com/android" >Download OGYouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/OGYouTube.jpg"                      alt="OGYouTube YouTube Alternative "                ></p><h5 id="Pros-36"><a href="#Pros-36" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>A great option for people who don’t have powerful Android phones</p><p>Lets you play videos while using other apps</p><p>The app doesn’t contain ads</p><h5 id="Cons-36"><a href="#Cons-36" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Not an official YouTube client app</p><p>Not available on Google Play Store</p><h3 id="3-YouTube-GO-3"><a href="#3-YouTube-GO-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p><p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p><p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li><li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li><li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li></ul><p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p><h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p><p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p><h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p><ol><li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li></ol><p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p><ol><li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li></ol><p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p><p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p><h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p><p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p><h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p><p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p><h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p><p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p><p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p><p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success.

All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event.

Even though Tiktok’s operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app ‘VINE’ was shut down back in 2016.</p><p>You can reap multiple benefits if you’re a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let’s look at your options of connecting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok</strong> and highlight h<strong>ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.</strong></p><p>Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your <strong>profile</strong> option.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the <strong>edit profile</strong> option and further select <strong>Add YouTube to Your Profile</strong> option.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the <strong>Google login screen</strong>.</p><p>Step 3: Click on <strong>“Allow” option</strong>. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.</p><p>Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not <strong>always clickable</strong>. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok?

Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.</p><p>As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements.

With over a billion downloads, TikTok is now more influential than ever. Here, you can consider all TikTok users to be prospective audiences or followers. Videos go viral every day, and a substantial portion of them come from a single source: TikTok.</p><p>The massively popular short-video app is the latest craze, with individuals from all over the world using it to watch and produce content. Instagram stars, YouTube stars, and even real-life movie stars have switched to this platform, so what’s stopping you? It has so much to offer. Both seem to work in a connected way as Tiktok stars are seen converting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Link a YouTube Video to TikTok Post?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2"> How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok?

Even though Tiktok’s operations were only launched outside of China a few years ago, Tiktok has entirely taken over the social sphere when it comes to producing amusing and enjoyable short videos, which has been seen after a very long time after the app ‘VINE’ was shut down back in 2016.</p><p>You can reap multiple benefits if you’re a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms. You can extend your reach and exposure to an immense number of people by linking your YouTube video to the TikTok post. Let’s look at your options of connecting videos from <strong>YouTube to TikTok</strong> and highlight h<strong>ow to connect TikTok to YouTube.</strong></p><p>Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your phone and tap on your <strong>profile</strong> option.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the <strong>edit profile</strong> option and further select <strong>Add YouTube to Your Profile</strong> option.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t previously linked your YouTube account to your TikTok channel, tapping on this will very certainly take you to another page with the <strong>Google login screen</strong>.</p><p>Step 3: Click on <strong>“Allow” option</strong>. By tapping on this, your YouTube channel will display as a link in your bio area.</p><p>Note: However, as we continue with this knowledge, it is worth noting that when you put your channel description and links under the videos you publish, the link is not <strong>always clickable</strong>. It is recommended that you keep with the bio section and conclude your short films by urging your viewers to visit your YouTube channel, which is included in the bio of your Tiktok profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-YouTube-Video-and-Post-to-TikTok-3-ways-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert YouTube Video and Post to TikTok?

Tiktok offers a 9:16 aspect ratio compared to most videos on YouTube, where the aspect ratio is primarily 16:9.</p><p>As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas. Tiktok is a platform that promotes videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes, compared to its initial support for content up to 15 seconds only. You will most likely have to resize your video if you plan to share it on Tiktok with all the above elements. Here are some of the video dimension details for TikTok.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1080 x 1920</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 9:16 Aspect Ratio</li><li><strong>File Format:</strong>.mp4 or .mov</li><li><strong>Code</strong>:  encoded</li></ul><p>We might have left you perplexed with all the information about <strong>how to connect TikTok to YouTube</strong>, but don’t worry, here are a variety of apps and a step-by-step guide for posting your videos on Tiktok without any issues.</p><h3 id="1-Kapwing-Studio-3"><a href="#1-Kapwing-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads. Well, they do this because the more subscribers they get, the more likely their videos appear in search results.</p><p>Also, if you have a huge Subscriber base, your videos tend to get more views, thereby increasing ad views, ad clicks, and your earnings.</p><p>All the factors explained above will determine how your YouTube earnings are calculated. However, keep in mind that you’ll receive only 55% of the total dollar advertisers pays while YouTube keeps the remaining 45%. If you get an average of $5 from an advertiser on every 1000 ad view, you’ll earn $5 x 55% which is approximately $2.75.</p><p>You can also calculate your YouTube channel total earnings by using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tunepocket.com/youtube-money-calculator/" >YouTube calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-check-youtube-income-7.jpg"                      alt="how to check youtube income on mobile phone 6"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-increase-your-YouTube-earnings-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?"></a>Part 3: How do you increase your YouTube earnings?</h2><h3 id="1-Post-quality-videos-1"><a href="#1-Post-quality-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users.

Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-2"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-2" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Have you ever felt worried about any YouTube comment that you published long ago, and later you realized that it was a mistake?

Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users.

Therefore, you might want to moderate all your comments before they become visible to the audience so as not to spread negativity among the mass. Fortunately, YouTube helps you get this done easily, and the instructions that teach you the process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to Your Channel’s Settings Box</strong></p><p>Sign in to your YouTube account, click the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the homepage, and click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p>From the bottom of the navigation bar on the left of the <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> page, click <strong>Settings</strong> to open the channel’s <strong>Settings</strong> box.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Moderate YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Go to the <strong>Community</strong> category from the left pane, and go to the <strong>Defaults</strong> tab from the right.

Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:</p><ul><li>Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can</li><li>Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency</li><li>Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment</li><li>In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble</li><li>Ignore the replies with inappropriate content</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About YouTube Comments"></a>FAQs About YouTube Comments</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.</p><p>In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

Wrongful Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#community">3.

Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes-3"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes-3"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes-3"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enlarge-Your-Video’s-Thumbnail-on-YouTube-Easily"><a href="#Enlarge-Your-Video’s-Thumbnail-on-YouTube-Easily" class="headerlink" title="Enlarge Your Video’s Thumbnail on YouTube Easily"></a>Enlarge Your Video’s Thumbnail on YouTube Easily</h2><p>There is a saying that first impressions last, and this is proven true, especially when it comes to YouTube video viewership. For sure, you have experienced watching a video out of curiosity because of its thumbnail. That is why content creators take time to resize YouTube thumbnails or use a YouTube thumbnail size converter to customize the preview images that represent their videos.</p><p>This technique not only attract viewers to watch your video, but it also gives a glimpse of your content. In this article, we will provide you with a quick tutorial on how to resize a YouTube thumbnail and suggest handy tools you can use to create the perfect YouTube video thumbnail!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resize-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="youtube thumbnail resize"                ></p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Thumbnail Size"></a>Best YouTube Thumbnail Size</h2><p>According to YouTube’s help center, there are some things to remember when creating a thumbnail for your YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>First, make sure that the thumbnail size is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels and 640 pixels wide. It is the best YouTube thumbnail size.</li><li>When it comes to the thumbnail dimension, make sure to use an aspect ratio of 16:9.</li><li>Also, your YouTube thumbnail image should not exceed 2MB and is in either JPG, GIF or PNG format.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail"></a>How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>The primary reason for changing the YouTube thumbnail size is to gain more audience. If you are a content creator, your main goal is to introduce your content to a wider range of viewers, right? So you have to pay attention to even the smallest detail, such as YouTube thumbnails to increase viewership and top YouTube SEO.</p><p>In fact, YouTube recommends this technique to get more viewers. Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the “file larger than 2MB error” which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.</p><p>So, how can you use this technique? Check our tutorial below as we walk you through various recommended methods for resizing a YouTube thumbnail:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App"></a>Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App</h3><p>The easiest way to resize YouTube thumbnails is through the Windows default app. Within just a few modifications, you can resize your thumbnail to fit as a preview image for your YouTube video.</p><p>Please take note that your image should be at least 2 megabytes or less to achieve the perfect YouTube thumbnail fit. If your image exceeds the limit, your thumbnail will either be rejected, or your image will have a black screen around it-which is not ideal at all.</p><p>Now, let us start the tutorial.</p><p>Step1 Open an image you want to set as a thumbnail. Then, <strong>Right-click&gt; Resize.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photo-for-youtube-thumbnail-resize.JPG"                      alt="select image for youtube thumbnail resize"                ></p><p>Step2 Select “Define custom dimensions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="youtube thumbnail custom dimensions"                ></p><p>Step3 Set the width to <strong>1280</strong> and the height to <strong>720</strong>. Then <strong>tick</strong> the box for “<strong>Maintain Aspect Ratio</strong> “and <strong>click “Save Resized Copy.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-ratio.jpg"                      alt="setting image width and height"                ></p><p>Step4 Click the upload thumbnail button on YouTube and <strong>import</strong> your resized image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-resize-finished.jpg"                      alt="upload resized thumbnail in youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Online-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-Converter"><a href="#Method-2-Online-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size-Converter" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Online YouTube Thumbnail Size Converter"></a>Method 2. Online YouTube Thumbnail Size Converter</h3><p>The second method you can use is the online YouTube thumbnail size converter. As it completely works in browsers, you do not need to worry about any app installation to access the feature. Furthermore, using online YouTube thumbnail size converters ensures you maintain your image resolution and prevents it from getting blurry or pixelated.</p><p>There are various YouTube thumbnail resizers available online.

It is one of the best YouTube Thumbnail tools as it uses simple operation steps and automatically resizes your image without losing its quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-size-converter-promo.JPG"                      alt="promo YouTube thumbnail size maker"                ></p><p>Here are the steps on how to use the Promo YouTube thumbnail size converter:</p><p>Step1 Go to Promo’s <a class="link"   href="https://promo.com/tools/image-resizer/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <strong>import</strong> your image</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-to-youtube-thumbnail-import.jpg"                      alt="importing image to promo"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down and find the YouTube thumbnail size where your resized image is displayed. Then, <strong>click “Download.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promo-download-youtube-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="promo download YouTube thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Convert-the-Image-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Method-3-Convert-the-Image-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Convert the Image to YouTube Thumbnail Using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Method 3: Convert the Image to YouTube Thumbnail Using Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>It is without a doubt that online YouTube thumbnail resizers are great tools for converting your image to an ideal YouTube thumbnail. But it would be much better if you resize your video using the same app you use for editing. That way, you will save time using two separate apps, and your task will be much more efficient using an all-in-one video editing tool.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, one of the most well-known software for creating high-quality and compelling videos, combines these functions in one app. Filmora is not just an excellent software for crafting YouTube videos but also a reliable tool you can use in creating and resizing YouTube thumbnails.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Here is the step-by-step tutorial on how to use Filmora in resizing your YouTube thumbnail. It is divided into two parts:</p><p><strong>1. Take a Snapshot as the Thumbnail with Filmora</strong></p><p>Step1 Open the video in the timeline, <strong>click</strong> the play icon in the player window, and <strong>pause</strong> when you reach the desired frame for the YouTube thumbnail. <strong>Click</strong> the camera icon to take a snapshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-open-video.jpg"                      alt="filmora open video"                ></p><p>Step2 In the snapshot window, <strong>choose</strong> to <strong>save</strong> the snapshot as a PNG or JPG file.</p><p>Step3 Select the output storage location and <strong>click OK</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-save-snapshot.jpg"                      alt="filmora save snapshot"                ></p><p><strong>2. Resize the YouTube Thumbnail</strong></p><p>Step1 Import the image into the app timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"                      alt="filmora import snapshot"                ></p><p>Step2 Drag and drop the image into the timeline and <strong>click</strong> the green “<strong>Export</strong>“ button. In the popup Export window, select <strong>GIF</strong>. Next, click “<strong>Settings</strong>“ to adjust the resolution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-adjust-gif-settings.jpg"                      alt="adjust filmora export settings"                ></p><p>Step3 As the recommended size of a YouTube Thumbnail is 1280 * 720 pixels, you can set the resolution to 1280 * 720. Then click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> the GIF. You can now upload the GIF thumbnail to your YouTube account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-adjust-resolution.JPG"                      alt="filmora adjust resolution"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Convert-Images-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Third-Party-Software"><a href="#Method-4-Convert-Images-to-YouTube-Thumbnail-Using-Third-Party-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software"></a>Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software</h3><p>In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails.

Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1.

Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content.

Community Guidelines Strikes"></a>3. Community Guidelines Strikes</h2><p>Most video creators – people who post vlogs, travel videos, and various kinds of tutorials – will never receive this type of strike. Sexual content, hateful content, threats, and scams are among the things you could post which would result in a community guidelines strike. Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks.

Creators, in general, are not interested in posting cruel or graphic content.</p><p>The only thing some video creators might have to be careful of is <strong>misleading metadata</strong>. You can get community guidelines to strike for intentionally using the title, tags, and description of your video to build up an expectation of the content your video does not deliver on. For example, if you post a personal vlog and title it ‘Call of Duty Review’ to try and capitalize on people who might be searching for gaming videos then you might receive a strike.</p><p>Blatantly using keywords that have nothing to do with your content is not something you can do accidentally, but it is possible to be misleading in your metadata without trying to be dishonest. YouTube is a very competitive place, and many creators are turning towards title strategies which could be considered ‘clickbait’. If you say in your title that you had a baby, but reveal in your actual video that ‘had a baby’ meant ‘wrote a new song’, will that get you a community guidelines strike? Probably not, but it can be a thin line.</p><p>In general, just don’t mention anything in your title or tags which you do not talk about in your video.</p><p>Community Guidelines strikes expire after three months. As long as you only have one strike, it will not affect your channel or what you can do on YouTube. If you receive a second strike within the three months of your first strike, you will lose the ability to post videos for two weeks. If you receive a third strike before either of your previous strikes has expired, your account will be terminated.</p><p> Have you experienced a copyright strike against your YouTube channel?

You can lose these privileges, have your ability to post videos frozen, and even have your account terminated if you start accumulating strikes.</p><p>If you receive a strike, you will usually be able to get rid of it. This article will show you how.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><p><a href="#strikes">1. Copyright Strikes</a></p><p><a href="#wrong">2.

Your account and all your videos will be deleted if you get three of either one of these types of strikes, but YouTube is fair about how these strikes are given out and how you can reverse them.</p><h2 id="1-Copyright-Strikes-3"><a href="#1-Copyright-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Copyright Strikes"></a>1. Copyright Strikes</h2><p>You get a copyright strike when you use media in your video which someone else owns the copyrights to. Music, clips, photographs, and sound effects are examples of the kinds of media you may use that could be owned by someone else.</p><p>The most obvious way to earn a copyright strike is to repost content which you did not create, i.e. clips from a television show or a popular song. If you know that the content you got a strike for was not yours and did not fall under <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >‘fair use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’, then there are two ways you can resolve it.</p><p>1. You can complete YouTube’s simple course on copyright infringement (<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >Copyright School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and wait three months. Copyright strikes expire in three months so long as you complete the course (they will not expire if you don’t take the course).</p><p>2. you can contact the holder of the copyright and ask them to retract their claim. You will probably have to offer to delete your video. Keep in mind that it is completely up to the rights holder whether you deleting your video is enough for them to retract their claim. They are allowed to say ‘no’.</p><p>Deleting your video, especially if you do so without contacting the rights holder, will not automatically reverse your copyright strike.</p><p>The majority of copyright strikes that you as a YouTube creator receive – if you receive any – will not be as black and white as ‘someone else owns it, you shouldn’t have used it’. If you know that you have a license to use the song or other media you got the strike for, or feel like your use of a clip falls under ‘fair use’, then your path to reversing the strike will be different.</p><h2 id="2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes-3"><a href="#2-Wrongful-Copyright-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes"></a>2. Wrongful Copyright Strikes</h2><p>YouTube’s system for detecting copyright infringement is automated. This means that you can get a copyright strike without actually breaking any rules. These strikes are generally easy to reverse.</p><p>For creators, the most common instance of this is being flagged for using copyrighted music. When you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download royalty-free music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – whether you download it for free or pay for it – you might not realize that that music is still copyrighted to someone else and can still be flagged by YouTube’s system.</p><p>If this has happened to you, reversing it is simple.</p><p>1. Submit a counter-notification through the form provided and include either your licensing information or a link to where it can be found online.</p><p>2. After you submit your counter-notification, the copyright holder will have 10 business days to respond. Since in this scenario the rights holder will know they have allowed their content to be licensed out, there should be no conflict and your video will be reinstated.</p><p>‘Fair use’ is another thing YouTube’s system has no way of detecting. ‘Fair use’ means that you are using content that you do not own, and which you do not have a license to use, but that you are using it in a way that is legally protected. Satire, criticism, education, and news reporting are areas that may be protected by fair use, although every situation is different.</p><p>There is no situation in which crediting a rights holder, adding a disclaimer, or simply not monetizing your video will make it fair use.</p><p>To reverse a copyright strike where you believe your video should be protected as ‘fair use’, submit a counter-notification through the web form YouTube provides. The rights holder will have 10 business days to provide YouTube with evidence that they have initiated a court action against your content. There is a chance that they will not agree with you about the ‘fair use’ status of your video. You could be in for a bit of a fight.</p><p>If your account has been suspended for accumulating multiple strikes, you will no longer be able to access the online counter-notification form and will have to send a free-form counter-notification. <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6005919" >Information on that can be found here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes-3"><a href="#3-Community-Guidelines-Strikes-3" class="headerlink" title="3.
