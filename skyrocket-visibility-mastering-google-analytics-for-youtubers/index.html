<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="youtube-creator-sutdio"
                ></p>
<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

                >  </p>
<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-region"
                >  </p>
<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.</p>

<h4 id="Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview"><a href="#Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview"></a><strong>Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview</strong></h4><p>In Overview you can see where the majority of your audience is from, what gender they are, how they are discovering your videos in Traffic Source, and where they are watching your video in Playback Locations:</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p>
<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>

<p>- YouTube Watch Page</p>
<p>- YouTube Channel Page</p>
<p>- Embedded Video Player (Website or App)</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-1"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-1" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-1"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-2"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>

<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Television producers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to data companies to get the same set of analytics that YouTube offers its creators for free.</p>
<p>Learning how to use analytics is not always a skill YouTubers think about when they are making videos, but it plays such an instrumental part throughout the whole stage of creation, from ideation to distribution.</p>
<p>Understanding how your videos are performing shines a light on your process, helps you evaluate what is working and what isn’t, and empower you to think beyond the lens and create videos that really resonates with your growing audience.</p>

<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-3"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview-3"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                >  </p>
<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-3"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-3" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos.

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Overview Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Overview Dashboard</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-3"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p>

<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>

<h4 id="See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-3"><a href="#See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-3" class="headerlink" title="See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment"></a><strong>See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment</strong></h4><p>If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.</p>
<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p>
<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>

<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>

<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value"><a href="#1-Give-Value" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original"><a href="#1-Be-Original" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews"><a href="#2-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough"><a href="#3-Walkthrough" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions"><a href="#4-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills"><a href="#5-Skills" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-1"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-1"><a href="#1-Give-Value-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-1"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-1"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-1"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-1"><a href="#1-Be-Original-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-1"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-1"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-1"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-1"><a href="#2-Reviews-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-1"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-1"><a href="#4-Reactions-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-1"><a href="#5-Skills-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-1"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-1"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-1"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-1"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-1"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Use readable text or emojis</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-1"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-1"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-1"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-1"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>
<li>Don’t go into YouTube gaming for the money, but rather to improve your skills and other people’s lives.</li>
<li>Find something special about your channel that people can’t find anywhere else.</li>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-2"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-2"><a href="#1-Give-Value-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-2"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-2"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-2"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-2"><a href="#1-Be-Original-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-2"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-2"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-2"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-2"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-2"><a href="#2-Reviews-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-2"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-2"><a href="#4-Reactions-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-2"><a href="#5-Skills-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-2"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-2"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-2"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-2"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-2"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-2"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p>

                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Use readable text or emojis</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t have Photoshop or don’t have strong design skills, check out <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare Pixstudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a drag-and-drop design tool that makes creating thumbnails easy.</p>
<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-2"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-2"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-2"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-2"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-2"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-2" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>
<li>Don’t go into YouTube gaming for the money, but rather to improve your skills and other people’s lives.</li>
<li>Find something special about your channel that people can’t find anywhere else.</li>
<li>YouTube gaming can be as cheap and as expensive as you want, create a budget to stay within your limits.</li>
<li>Understand optimization to improve your chances of viewers finding your content.</li>
<li>Don’t be hateful or advertisers will avoid you, and don’t steal other people’s content without crediting the original creator.</li>

<p>It’s the best time because you will have so many pioneers and successful creators to draw inspiration and knowledge from. You’ll be standing on the shoulders of giants like PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and CinnamonToastKen.</p>
<p>The trail has been blazed and you’re in the new frontier. Now, here’s what you need to know about starting a YouTube gaming channel.</p>
<h2 id="1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-3"><a href="#1-Have-a-Greater-Purpose-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Have a Greater Purpose"></a>1. Have a Greater Purpose</h2><p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://tubularinsights.com/15-per-cent-youtube-gaming-videos/" >Tubular Insights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 15% of all content on YouTube is related to video games. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of 2018, YouTube has a new monetization requirement. To enable monetization, you will need <strong>1,000 subscribers</strong> and <strong>4,000 hours</strong> of watch time in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>If you think you can make a few videos and start making money, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to disappoint you. YouTube is fun and a wonderful way to increase the social aspect of gaming and enhance your enjoyment. Approach it the same way you’ve approached gaming all along, as a fun way to spend your time.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey… and what a journey it can be. Do it for the love of playing games and making videos, and not about getting subscribers or views. If you don’t change your attitude, it’s a grueling climb if all you want is to reach the finish line (which is nowhere in sight).</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Well, if you don’t have a greater purpose than simply growing subscribers and making money off YouTube, then you are going to get discouraged and give up. It’s not a get-rich-fast plan.</p>
<p>Here is how you find your greater purpose:</p>
<h4 id="1-Give-Value-3"><a href="#1-Give-Value-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Give Value"></a>1. Give Value</h4><p>You want to make good YouTube gaming content like those popular YouTubers that came before you.</p>
<p>But… what makes good YouTube content?</p>
<p>Simply put, good content should exhibit these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Entertaining</strong>: Tell a story and sensationalize the emotions that come out of you when you play games.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong>: Find hidden stages, new tricks, and talk about the lore and history that brought this game to life.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: Encourage viewers to try new games and play along. Help people discover their next pastime and thank viewers for spending their time with you.</p>
<p> This is what gives your content value, and creating content with value should be your ultimate purpose. Making your viewers feel good is, in a way, better than money, no?</p>
<h4 id="2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-3"><a href="#2-Make-YouTube-a-Part-of-Your-Daily-Weekly-Ritual-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual"></a>2. Make YouTube a Part of Your Daily&#x2F;Weekly Ritual</h4><p>YouTube should be a part of your regular schedule.</p>
<p>At first, it’ll be easy. Like anything new, your YouTube channel will have a novelty to it. It’s this exciting new project that you have.</p>
<p>But after the first month, that excitement will dampen. By the third month, it’ll become familiar. Here’s where you have to fight the urge to stop. This is where author, Seth Godin calls <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.ca/dip-Seth-Godin/dp/1591841666" >The Dip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It’s now working. And like all work, you’ll have to schedule it into your daily life. You’ll have to prioritize YouTube above hanging out with friends, watching another movie, or playing video games without the strain of recording it and being entertaining&#x2F;educating&#x2F;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, if you are getting fulfillment from YouTube, you won’t stop even when the going gets hard. Like being a parent, it’s not always fun, but it should always be fulfilling.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Mark when you are going to be working on YouTube in a calendar, so when someone asks you to hang out or go for dinner, you can check it and let them know you already have plans.</p>
<h4 id="3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-3"><a href="#3-Have-a-Passion-to-Get-Better-At-Every-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step"></a>3. Have a Passion to Get Better At Every Step</h4><p>There are many stages to producing a YouTube video, from pre-production to production to post-production. And within those stages are countless steps.</p>
<p>If YouTube is what you want to do, perhaps the greatest purpose you can have is improving on each of those skill sets along the way.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you will have a surplus of ideas, but once your initial stock of video ideas run dry, you will need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >practice coming up with more ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get better at recording your gameplay, at speaking on camera, at editing your footage, at optimizing your content, and at sharing your videos.</p>
<p>You will enjoy certain steps more than others, but if you are passionate, you will find comfort in striving to improve in each one, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>:<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Focus on telling a great story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In every video, you should have an objective you want to accomplish. You want to beat a stage, you want to learn a new skill, etc. Once you nail that, all the other elements (screen recording, editing, and your commentary) will fall into place to guide your story from beginning to end.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-an-Identity-3"><a href="#2-Create-an-Identity-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Identity"></a>2. Create an Identity</h2><p>Your personality and your channel will need to go through a little<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >branding exercise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You need to find what sets yourself apart from all the other gaming channels on the Internet. Ask yourself, and be honest with the answer: Why should anyone care about my channel?</p>
<h4 id="1-Be-Original-3"><a href="#1-Be-Original-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Original"></a>1. Be Original</h4><p>Take inspiration from other YouTubers and adjust it so that it’s unique. You cannot copy the ideas of popular YouTubers, because the public can see that. They can tell the difference between originality and imitation.</p>
<p>Being original doesn’t mean doing something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jacksepticeye and Markiplier, both are popular YouTubers recognized for their colorful hair, mass use of profanity, and their Let’s Play style of gaming videos. But if you watch their videos, you can see that they are not copying each other but rather adjusting what has proven to be effective to suit their personality.</p>
<p>If something inspires you and you want to make an original version yourself, don’t think that you need to do something completely different, rather ask, how can I make that awesome thing better?</p>
<h4 id="2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-3"><a href="#2-Focus-on-a-Specific-Aspect-of-Game-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game"></a>2. Focus on a Specific Aspect of Game</h4><p>Odds are, you’ll end up playing the same game as other YouTubers. If you’re playing a popular game, then it’s going to be hard for you to establish an audience if your videos are broad.</p>
<p>Consider how your viewers will discover your videos. Are they going to find you through search? If so, what are they searching? There are many aspects to a video game: characters, glitches, stages, etc.</p>
<p>Find a specific aspect of the game to focus on.</p>
<p>Take YouTuber, NoughtPointFourLive, who instead of playing the game via a linear campaign, finds ridiculous situations, odd tricks, and easter eggs in Grand Theft Auto:</p>
<h4 id="3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-3"><a href="#3-Hook-Audience-With-Something-Funny-Or-Interesting-—-And-Lead-Up-To-It-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It"></a>3. Hook Audience With Something Funny Or Interesting — And Lead Up To It</h4><p>Every video you make should tell a story. It doesn’t matter if the storyline is the one in the video game or if it’s happening to you in real life. What matters is that you are aware of where the climax is.</p>
<p>The climax is what your story hinges on: it’s when Mario confronts Bowser.</p>
<p>This is what your audience is watching for. They want to know who wins.</p>
<p>To hook your audience right away, open with the most exciting part. The bit leading up to the climax. But don’t give away the ending. You want to hook them. Give a promise that this video is worth watching and that eventually, it will deliver.</p>
<p>Check out this example from YouTuber, Lachlan playing Fortnite and landing back at Spawn Island, an artillery-filled waiting area for players before the game starts.</p>
<p>This structure can be applied with humor as well as climatic events. If you open with something funny, it gets the viewer engaged immediately. They want to know what led up to that humorous moment.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example from YouTuber, Jelly. He does a great job at injecting humor into his first few seconds of video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Type-of-Gaming-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Gaming Videos"></a>3. Type of Gaming Videos</h2><p>There are no rules to making gaming videos. As long as it’s worth watching and you aren’t stealing content, that is all that matters. Nevertheless, there are a few standard types of gaming videos that have been established over the years.</p>
<h4 id="1-Let’s-Plays-3"><a href="#1-Let’s-Plays-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Let’s Plays"></a>1. Let’s Plays</h4><p>Turn the game on and start playing. Let’s Plays give you a lot of freedom to explore the game and let your personality show in the commentary. You don’t need to play with a strategy, but do have a particular goal in mind (Finishing a level, for example).</p>
<p>Let’s Plays are more about watching you experience the game. A demographic of people watching Let’s Plays are those that don’t have the game themselves, but still want to experience it. Let them live vicariously through you.</p>
<h4 id="2-Reviews-3"><a href="#2-Reviews-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Reviews"></a>2. Reviews</h4><p>When you’re deciding whether or not to buy a new product where do you go to research? Google and YouTube. If you have a lot of interesting insights after playing a game, making reviews videos might just be your calling. There are many games on the market, and for consumers, it can get overwhelming. Reviews help others decide whether they should invest their money and their time into that specific game or continue searching.</p>
<h4 id="3-Walkthrough-3"><a href="#3-Walkthrough-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Walkthrough"></a>3. Walkthrough</h4><p>Unlike Let’s Plays and reviews, walkthrough videos are mapped out and structured to help the viewers pass the game while experiencing events, side quests, and characters they would otherwise have missed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Reactions-3"><a href="#4-Reactions-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Reactions"></a>4. Reactions</h4><p>Misery or excitement, when you genuinely react to an event in a game, the audience gets to experience it along your side. Give the moment a bit of lead up, let people know what you are expecting, and then surprise yourself. Reaction videos are great because they are spontaneous and a wonderful form of presenting your personality.</p>
<h4 id="5-Skills-3"><a href="#5-Skills-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Skills"></a>5. Skills</h4><p>Video games are hard to master. But if you think you are proficient in an aspect of the game, show off your moves. Is there a particular trick that you can do? Is there a stage you can beat quickly? Are you able to take down your enemy with ease? Prove it.</p>
<h2 id="4-Have-a-Budget-3"><a href="#4-Have-a-Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Have a Budget"></a>4. Have a Budget</h2><p>When you begin your YouTube gaming journey, you are going to see a lot of established YouTubers showing off their gear. It’s easy to get carried away with equipment, but we recommend setting a budget and staying within it to start.</p>
<p>What’s a good budget for YouTubers? Some might say you can do it for $600 and others say $3000. That’s a big range.</p>
<p>What you need to ask yourself is what do you currently have.</p>
<p>Are you starting with nothing? Or do you have some essentials? If you have a computer, which can play the game of your choice, you don’t need to spend $2000 on a new one. Look at what you currently have before buying new stuff.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need to get the best results:</p>
<p>- Microphone (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Webcam (Average cost: $100)</p>
<p>- Editing Software (Average cost: $300)</p>
<p>- PC that can handle recording, editing, rendering, uploading, etc. (Average cost: $2,000)</p>
<p>If you are starting out, all you need is a computer with a capable CPU and GPU, a webcam, a microphone, and a free encoding software, such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you will be able to stream.</p>
<p>Even PewDiePie started with a basic gaming setup.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend blowing your life savings on all the equipment you want. Don’t have a powerful computer? There are games such as Minecraft and Roblox that are less taxing to your computer, if you don’t have a powerful one.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around it, if you don’t currently have the funds. Being a YouTuber is all about being resourceful and creative.</p>
<p>You don’t need professional editing software, there are affordable ones such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>that have all the capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="1-Many-Games-Are-Free-3"><a href="#1-Many-Games-Are-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Many Games Are Free"></a>1. Many Games Are Free</h4><p>Here’s the great thing about starting as a video game YouTuber, you don’t need to pay for any games. I’m not only talking about the crappy Flash games on the Internet, but massively popular games such as Fortnite and DOTA are also free to start playing as well.</p>
<p>If you’re strapped for cash. Start your channel playing free games and work your way towards more expensive games.</p>
<h4 id="2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-3"><a href="#2-Some-Software-Are-Free-As-Well-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Some Software Are Free As Well"></a>2. Some Software Are Free As Well</h4><p><strong>OBS</strong>: This streaming software allows you to capture your game in top quality and broadcast it directly to YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >It’s a simple setup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s completely free.</p>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong>: This audio recording and editing software is great if you want to improve the quality of your audio by removing background noise or combining clips.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong>: Probably the closest free product to Photoshop you can find. GIMP will help you perform basic image manipulation. It’s not as user friendly as Photoshop, but you can learn the fundamentals here as you save up for the Creative Cloud subscription plan.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimization-Matters-3"><a href="#5-Optimization-Matters-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimization Matters"></a>5. Optimization Matters</h2><p>Gaming is arguably the most popular genre on YouTube. So, how is your little video going to be discovered in this vast sea of gaming content?</p>
<p>The answer: with a good optimization strategy.</p>
<h4 id="1-Tags-and-Title-3"><a href="#1-Tags-and-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Tags and Title"></a>1. Tags and Title</h4><p>When conceptualizing your next video, consider what your viewers are going to search to find it. This will help you focus your gameplay to meet the demand of this untapped (or more specific) audience.</p>
<p>You can use a plugin called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keyword score by simply searching for the content you think your viewers are interested in watching.</p>
<p>If you’re playing Fortnite, and your keyword is simply “Fortnite” you’re using a highly searched term, but the competition is very high as well. The odds of your ranking is incredibly tough as the overall keyword score is 61&#x2F;100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-1.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>However, if you focus on a more specific aspect of the game to make a video around, such as a character, you can heighten your chance at being discovered.</p>
<p>Take the example below, where I added the keyword “Striker” to the search. Its overall keyword score is 87&#x2F;100, that’s 26 points better in the keyword score, compared to just “Fortnite.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-youtube-gaming-seo-with-vidiq-2.jpg"
                      alt=" Optimize Gaming Channel with VidIQ"
                ></p>
<p>This will help you identify the content you should be making and then use that keyword knowledge to write a good title and a list of 5-15 tags.</p>
<p> Few more tips to improving your titles include:</p>
<p>- Avoid uninspiring words like “Fun,” “Exciting,” or “Great.”</p>
<p>- Once you have a title do a quick search to see if it already exists. Common titles make it harder for yours to rank.</p>
<p>- Have the title relate to the game. If there are certain words or phrases that players are familiar with, go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>- Make it click-worthy by promising something unique, but don’t mislead viewers.</p>
<h4 id="2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-3"><a href="#2-Create-Awesome-Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Awesome Thumbnails"></a>2. Create Awesome Thumbnails</h4><p>It doesn’t matter how awesome your video is, if the thumbnail image is boring, nobody will want to click into it. And if nobody clicks into it, you won’t get any views. Simple.</p>
<p>What makes a good thumbnail image?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t use the random images YouTube picks for you</li>
<li>Have an expressive picture of a human face (preferably of yours, because it’s your gaming channel and you’re the star)</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at The Syndicate Project’s thumbnails and how it evokes an intensity that makes you want to click — or scream with excitement. Both good things.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-awesome-thumbnail-youtube-gaming-1.jpg"
                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t want to use your face? Create a character for yourself or to represent your channel. Or used the characters from the actual game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the colorful thumbnails from VanossGaming, where the owl is the mascot of their channel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Thumbnail for YouTube Channel"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Use readable text or emojis</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-3"><a href="#3-Engage-with-Other-Gamers-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Engage with Other Gamers"></a>3. Engage with Other Gamers</h4><p>Don’t forget that YouTube is a social media platform.</p>
<p>It’s all about being a part of a YouTube community, and while you can’t interact with every creator on the platform, you can find those within your niche or specific game and chat with them. Leave a comment if you like their video or have constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Additionally, viewer engagements such as likes and comments have shown to have an indirect effect on your video ranking. That is why you should encourage your viewers to “smash” the like button or join in a conversation by asking them a question in your video.</p>
<h2 id="6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-3"><a href="#6-Be-Cautious-of-Content-Strike-and-Demonetization-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization"></a>6. Be Cautious of Content Strike and Demonetization</h2><h4 id="1-Cause-for-Demonetization-3"><a href="#1-Cause-for-Demonetization-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Cause for Demonetization"></a>1. Cause for Demonetization</h4><p>The YouTube monetization landscape has changed a lot for creators in the past few years. The guidelines are always being adjusted to serve both creators and advertisers. If you’re thinking of making money from YouTube ads, you have to be aware that there are types of content that turn advertisers off, and YouTube knows it. Here are some reasons that YouTube will choose to demonetize your videos:</p>
<p>- Excessive or gratuitous violence</p>
<p>- Hateful content: promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates and individual or group of people (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)</p>
<p>- Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters</p>
<p>- Incendiary and demeaning content: disrespectful languages that shame or insult an individual or group</p>
<h4 id="2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-3"><a href="#2-Avoiding-Copyright-Strike-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoiding Copyright Strike"></a>2. Avoiding Copyright Strike</h4><p>Thanks to the fair use doctrine, you’re allowed to take video game content and make videos from it without acquiring permission from the people who made the game.</p>
<p>However, if you step across the fair use line, you can be penalized for violating copyright infringement.</p>
<p>If you get three strikes from YouTube in 90 days, your account and videos will be removed and you won’t be allowed to create a new channel.</p>
<p>Before you publish your video ask yourself these questions, if you answer yes to any of them then you have met fair use standards:</p>
<p>- Is your content creative or educational?</p>
<p>- Is there more original content than copyrighted content?</p>
<p>- Is your video benefiting the original content?</p>
<p>I recommend that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube copyright <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and how to build your content so that it doesn’t get flagged.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, it’s about playing games, having a good time, and meeting awesome people like yourself. Enjoy the journey and take pleasure in every little achievement, be it in the game or on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><ol>
