<p><strong>Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p>
<p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p>
<p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p>
<p>This is why <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p>
<h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>. To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p>
<h3 id="1-DEVUMI"><a href="#1-DEVUMI" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p>
<h3 id="2-BuyViews"><a href="#2-BuyViews" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p>
<h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p>
<h3 id="4-500VIEWS"><a href="#4-500VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p>
<h3 id="5-Social-Shop"><a href="#5-Social-Shop" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p>
<h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p>
<p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p>
<p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p>
<p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p>
<p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p>
<p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p>
<p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p>
<h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p>
<p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p>
<h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p>
<p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p>
<p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p>
<p> What do you think? Would you buy YouTube views, or can you get by growing your channel organically?</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p>
<p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p>
<p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p>
<p>This is why <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p>
<h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-1"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-1" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>. To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p>
<h3 id="1-DEVUMI-1"><a href="#1-DEVUMI-1" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p>
<h3 id="2-BuyViews-1"><a href="#2-BuyViews-1" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p>
<h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven-1"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven-1" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p>
<h3 id="4-500VIEWS-1"><a href="#4-500VIEWS-1" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p>
<h3 id="5-Social-Shop-1"><a href="#5-Social-Shop-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p>
<h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-1"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-1" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above.

However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p>
<h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-2"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS-2" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>.

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p>
<h3 id="1-DEVUMI-2"><a href="#1-DEVUMI-2" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p>
<h3 id="2-BuyViews-2"><a href="#2-BuyViews-2" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p>
<h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven-2"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven-2" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p>
<h3 id="4-500VIEWS-2"><a href="#4-500VIEWS-2" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p>
<h3 id="5-Social-Shop-2"><a href="#5-Social-Shop-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p>
<h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-2"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK-2" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p>
<p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p>
<p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p>
<p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE-2" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p>
<p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p>
<p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p>
<p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p>
<h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL-2" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p>
<p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p>
<h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-2"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE-2" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p>
<p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p>
<p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p>
<p> What do you think? Would you buy YouTube views, or can you get by growing your channel organically?</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p>
<p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p>
<p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p>
<p>This is why <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p>

To do this, go to Creator Studio and then Video Manager. You’ll see a button labeled “Edit” next to each video, and an arrow pointing down. Click <strong>Thumbnail Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>In Thumbnail Editor, you can use the still images in the video as a thumbnail, choose a solid background color for the thumbnail, or add other images from your computer. I will show you the steps of how to customize the video still as a video thumbnail.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Preview the video and choose the target video still.</strong> You can click the Playback button and check the video and pause it at the desired frame. Or, you can step through each frame by clicking the Preview Frame button and Next Frame icon. Click Next to continue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>2. And now, you can <strong>add text, image and shape overlays to the thumbnail.</strong> You can change the text font, size, opacity and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Next</strong> to save the thumbnail and you will see how the thumbnail displays on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the video thumbnail.</p>
<p>In this way, you can add a custom thumbnail to the new videos and change the video thumbnail of the previously uploaded videos.</p>

<li>About the proper YouTube video thumbnail size: Your thumbnail should be 1280x720 pixels in size and be less than 2MB. The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li>
<li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li>
<li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li>
<li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel. This can actually remove your ability to use custom thumbnails, so keep it honest!</p>

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p>
<p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"
                ></p>
<p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p>
<p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p>
<p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "
                ></p>
<p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p>
<p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p>
<h4 id="3-People-Like-People"><a href="#3-People-Like-People" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p>
<p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p>
<p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p>
<p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p>
<h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p>
<p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p>
<p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p>
<h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p>
<p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"
                ></p>
<p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p>
<h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p>
<p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p>

To do this, go to Creator Studio and then Video Manager. You’ll see a button labeled “Edit” next to each video, and an arrow pointing down. Click <strong>Thumbnail Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>In Thumbnail Editor, you can use the still images in the video as a thumbnail, choose a solid background color for the thumbnail, or add other images from your computer. I will show you the steps of how to customize the video still as a video thumbnail.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Preview the video and choose the target video still.</strong> You can click the Playback button and check the video and pause it at the desired frame. Or, you can step through each frame by clicking the Preview Frame button and Next Frame icon. Click Next to continue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>2. And now, you can <strong>add text, image and shape overlays to the thumbnail.</strong> You can change the text font, size, opacity and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Next</strong> to save the thumbnail and you will see how the thumbnail displays on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the video thumbnail.</p>
<p>In this way, you can add a custom thumbnail to the new videos and change the video thumbnail of the previously uploaded videos.</p>

<li>About the proper YouTube video thumbnail size: Your thumbnail should be 1280x720 pixels in size and be less than 2MB. The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li>
<li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li>
<li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li>
<li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel. This can actually remove your ability to use custom thumbnails, so keep it honest!</p>

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-1"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p>
<p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"
                ></p>
<p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p>
<p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-1"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p>
<p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "
                ></p>
<p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p>
<p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p>
<h4 id="3-People-Like-People-1"><a href="#3-People-Like-People-1" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p>
<p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p>
<p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p>
<p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p>
<h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition-1"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p>
<p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p>
<p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p>
<h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-1"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p>
<p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"
                ></p>
<p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p>
<h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-1"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p>
<p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p>

To do this, go to Creator Studio and then Video Manager. You’ll see a button labeled “Edit” next to each video, and an arrow pointing down. Click <strong>Thumbnail Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>In Thumbnail Editor, you can use the still images in the video as a thumbnail, choose a solid background color for the thumbnail, or add other images from your computer. I will show you the steps of how to customize the video still as a video thumbnail.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Preview the video and choose the target video still.</strong> You can click the Playback button and check the video and pause it at the desired frame. Or, you can step through each frame by clicking the Preview Frame button and Next Frame icon. Click Next to continue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>2. And now, you can <strong>add text, image and shape overlays to the thumbnail.</strong> You can change the text font, size, opacity and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Next</strong> to save the thumbnail and you will see how the thumbnail displays on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the video thumbnail.</p>
<p>In this way, you can add a custom thumbnail to the new videos and change the video thumbnail of the previously uploaded videos.</p>

<li>About the proper YouTube video thumbnail size: Your thumbnail should be 1280x720 pixels in size and be less than 2MB. The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li>
<li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li>
<li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li>
<li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel. This can actually remove your ability to use custom thumbnails, so keep it honest!</p>

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-2"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p>
<p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"
                ></p>
<p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p>
<p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-2"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p>
<p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "
                ></p>
<p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p>
<p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p>
<h4 id="3-People-Like-People-2"><a href="#3-People-Like-People-2" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p>
<p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p>
<p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p>
<p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p>
<h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition-2"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p>
<p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p>
<p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p>
<h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-2"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p>
<p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"
                ></p>
<p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p>
<h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-2"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p>
<p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p>

To do this, go to Creator Studio and then Video Manager. You’ll see a button labeled “Edit” next to each video, and an arrow pointing down. Click <strong>Thumbnail Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>In Thumbnail Editor, you can use the still images in the video as a thumbnail, choose a solid background color for the thumbnail, or add other images from your computer. I will show you the steps of how to customize the video still as a video thumbnail.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Preview the video and choose the target video still.</strong> You can click the Playback button and check the video and pause it at the desired frame. Or, you can step through each frame by clicking the Preview Frame button and Next Frame icon. Click Next to continue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-video-still.jpg"
                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>2. And now, you can <strong>add text, image and shape overlays to the thumbnail.</strong> You can change the text font, size, opacity and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Next</strong> to save the thumbnail and you will see how the thumbnail displays on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the video thumbnail.</p>
<p>In this way, you can add a custom thumbnail to the new videos and change the video thumbnail of the previously uploaded videos.</p>

<li>About the proper YouTube video thumbnail size: Your thumbnail should be 1280x720 pixels in size and be less than 2MB. The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li>
<li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li>
<li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li>
<li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel. This can actually remove your ability to use custom thumbnails, so keep it honest!</p>

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic-3"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p>
<p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"
                ></p>
<p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p>
<p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-3"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p>
<p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious "
                ></p>
<p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p>
<p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p>
<h4 id="3-People-Like-People-3"><a href="#3-People-Like-People-3" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p>
<p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p>
<p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p>
<p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p>
<h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition-3"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p>
<p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p>
<p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p>
<h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-3"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p>
<p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"
                      alt=" YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"
                ></p>
<p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p>
<h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p>
<p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p>

What is YouTube Thumbnail?</h4><p>When you upload a video on YouTube, YouTube gives you three images to choose from in the selection of your video’s thumbnail image.

Being ranked higher gets you more views, and even more watch time. It’s a wonderful cycle that all begins with a great thumbnail (paired with a good title and the right tags).</p>
