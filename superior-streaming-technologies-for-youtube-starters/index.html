<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p>
<p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This is yet another broadcasting software that is equipped with powerful screen recording tools. Setting up a new screencasting session with XSplit is a simple and intuitive process that is not going to take much more than a few moments of your time.</p>
<p>All you need to do is define a workspace, then pick the preferred resolution and frame rate. The software allows you to capture screens in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and at 60 fps, but it also offers a variety of resolution and frame rate options so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a screen recorder that is stacked with powerful video editing features, then Filmora is a great option for you. Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.</p>
<p>Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.</p>
<p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys. Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.</p>

<p>DemoCreator is a recorder that focuses its overall user experience. It is able to easily record high-quality videos at up to 120 FPS (60 FPS for Mac) and allows you to simultaneously record both your screen and webcam. This software is incredibly user friendly and makes for an easy experience for new streamers. The dual recording makes it great for gamers who are also looking to film their reactions.</p>
<h3 id="5-CloudApp"><a href="#5-CloudApp" class="headerlink" title="5.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome</p>
<p>Starting a new screen capturing session with the CloudApp requires you to just specify the portion of the screen you want to capture and hit the record button. Moreover, you can choose if you want to record with or without a webcam and you have the option to enable or disable the audio recording option.</p>
<p>However, you can only create 90-second screen recordings with the free version of the CloudApp and you cannot set resolution or frame rate of the recording. That’s why you need to upgrade to the Pro version if you want to use it to record live streams on YouTube. The Pro subscription model also grants you access to basic video editing tools and a variety of file sharing options. In addition, CloudApp lets you create and annotate still images and GIFs, which makes it a great option for digital marketers.</p>

<p>Camtasia lets you choose if you want to record the full screen or just a selected portion of the screen or decide if you want to switch the webcam or the microphone off. You should make sure that the System Audio feature is enabled in order to record the sound of the live stream you’re sharing on YouTube. Pausing or stopping a screencasting session requires you to either click on the appropriate buttons or use the keyboard-based hotkeys. After you are done recording a live stream you can edit the footage using Camtasia’s video editing tools.</p>

<p>Flashback Express is a simple screen recorder that lets you create high-res videos effortlessly. Setting up a new screencasting session requires you to just specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose whether or not you want to record the webcam feed and hit the Record button.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions in terms of the duration of screen recordings you can make with Flashback Express and the software doesn’t watermark the video you create.</p>
<p>However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.</p>
<p>This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market. Having said that, it is still an excellent tool that will help you live stream gameplay easily. Although it doesn’t come with built-in video editing software, it is possible to download another program to do this for you (i.e. Filmora). Flashback Express has the ability to record through your headset or microphone as well.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-1"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p>
<p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p>

<p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys.

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-2"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-2" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio-2"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p>
<p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p>

Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.</p>
<p>Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.</p>
<p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys.

<p>However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-3"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio-3"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p>
<p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p>

Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.</p>
<p>Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.</p>
<p>What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys. Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.</p>

<p>There are no restrictions in terms of the duration of screen recordings you can make with Flashback Express and the software doesn’t watermark the video you create.</p>
<p>However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.</p>
<p>This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market. Having said that, it is still an excellent tool that will help you live stream gameplay easily. Although it doesn’t come with built-in video editing software, it is possible to download another program to do this for you (i.e. Filmora). Flashback Express has the ability to record through your headset or microphone as well.</p>

The Screen Recording window where you can choose if you want to record audio or show mouse click in the recording will pop up on the screen. QuickTime Player lets you choose if you want to capture the entire screen or just a portion of it, and you can click on the Record button to start a new screencasting session.

<p> We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.</p>
<p><strong>2. User Interface:</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:</strong></p>

If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end.

In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations.

YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?"></a>Facebook Live Vs. YouTube Live Vs. Periscope: What’s the Difference?</h2><p><strong>1. Audience:</strong></p>
<p> We all know that Facebook is currently having highest user base so naturally Facebook Live is assumed to have more viewers and streamers. Google considers most of the YouTube content valuable but note that it is YouTube not the recently updated YouTube Live platform. On the other side, if we talk about Periscope then it can be best described as a standalone network. In case if it gets linked to main app YouTube then it may avail some popularity in the market, same as that of Facebook. If you are a beginner then probably, Facebook is the best choice for you as it can provide more audience over the nights. Periscope users can also enjoy healthy content over Mobile phones with great stream quality. One more interesting thing to know about Periscope is that it can be used to develop healthy relationships with so many viewers and followers.</p>
<p><strong>2. User Interface:</strong></p>
<p> Here is one more interesting factor to discuss about all these amazing Live streaming platforms. This feature makes a system or software standout among other competitors. If we compare user interface of Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube Live then you will find them all almost similar. But most of the beginners rate Facebook as most simple and user friendly tool for live broadcasts. Second rating is received by Periscope whereas YouTube Live stands on third level. User interface of Periscope and Facebook live possesses so many similar features such as ability to subscribe, comment or updating likes etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Saving Broadcasts and Embedding Replays:</strong></p>
<p> Let us discuss about saving broadcasts as well as get some idea about their ability to arrange embedding replays. The video archiving ability of YouTube and Facebook is having almost similar kind of features. Users are able to update their live streams and they can also be saved for longer run, even permanently as per need. If you want to delete them then simple controls allow easy removal of updated broadcasts from channel. On the other side, Periscope allows live streamers to stay on channel only for 24 hours. After that, all the updated videos get automatically deleted. On Facebook, users cannot come to know about who is watching their live streams until and unless they receive comments from viewers. Although, Facebook keep on updating notifications about all live streams but more often they create a bug. In case of Periscope, whenever a person starts viewing your uploaded content, his name will directly appear at your end. It can help you to know the real strength of your updates so that you can improve quality of content as per interest of viewers. It is also possible to make private or public settings for broadcasts on Periscope whereas Facebook is gaining more popularity for its Split Screen and 360 videos.</p>
<p><strong>4. Interaction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Communicate with Broadcasters:</strong></p>
<p> If you want to interact with broadcaster on Facebook then you can simply update your comment or show them your reaction with emojies. They can be updated at the time of live broadcasts as well as at the time of replay. Most of the Facebook users are unhappy with its lag time as broadcasters comment gets published after a delay of 30 seconds. In case of Periscope, viewers are able to just comment on live broadcasts and they can also update a heart for their favourite content. If we compare the lag time of Facebook and Periscope then it is lower for Periscope and people often enjoy instantaneous conversations over this network. The best part is that Viewers can update numbers of hearts even for single broadcast and all of them will get recorded. This feature is not available with Facebook emojies. You will be glad to know that once you have prepared account over YouTube then same details can be used to access Periscope platform.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction with Viewers:</strong></p>
<p> Facebook allows broadcasters and viewers to enjoy healthy communication as here talks can be initiated by updating name of the person before writing comment. If you want to communicate with all viewers in more professional manner then Facebook’s name based comment updates are best choices. Note that, facebook allows users to enjoy communicate even when stream has already ended. In case of Periscope, again viewers and broadcasters can enjoy direct name to name comment based conversations. Periscope broadcasts can also be enjoyed on Twitter platform directly but here you cannot update hearts directly. Also, comments remains dedicated to Twitter and Periscope environment.
