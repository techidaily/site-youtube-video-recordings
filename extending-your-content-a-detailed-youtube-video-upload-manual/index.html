<h2 id="What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal"><a href="#What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal" class="headerlink" title="What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?"></a>What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</h2><p>YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p>
<p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p>
<p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p>
<p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li>
<li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li>
<li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li>
<li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process"><a href="#How-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-To-Youtube-In-A-Step-by-step-Process" class="headerlink" title="How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?"></a>How To Upload Longer Videos To Youtube In A Step-by-step Process?</h2><p>YouTube allows users to submit videos up to 15 minutes in length by default.

<h2 id="What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-2"><a href="#What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?"></a>What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</h2><p>YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p>
<p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p>
<p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-2"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p>
<p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li>
<li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li>
<li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li>
<li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li>

<p>ASMR can be triggered by visual, audio, and tactile stimuli, which is the reason why most YouTubers who produce this type of content dedicate a lot of attention to the image and sound quality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vast majority of ASMR videos you can find on YouTube utilizes audio triggers to spark the autonomous sensory meridian response in one form or the other. Consequently, the quality of the audio recording determines whether or not your videos will be able to trigger ASMR. That’s why we selected some of the ASMR microphones novice and seasoned YouTubers can use to record the audio for their ASMR YouTube videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have"><a href="#Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?"></a>Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?</h2><p>Thinking that you can use any microphone you can lay your hands on to record sound for you ASMR videos is a mistake, because the quality of the recording may not be at a satisfactory level if your microphone is producing a lot of self-noise or if it is not able to pick up soft noises.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the features and ASMR microphone should have.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-mic’s-source-of-power"><a href="#1-The-mic’s-source-of-power" class="headerlink" title="1. The mic’s source of power"></a>1. The mic’s source of power</h3><p>A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.</p>
<p>The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction"><a href="#2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction" class="headerlink" title="2. The microphone’s recording direction"></a>2. The microphone’s recording direction</h3><p>Although there are a number of direction categories of microphones, ASMR content produces commonly use Omnidirectional and Binaural mics.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, an omnidirectional microphone can pick up sounds from all sides, which makes it a good option if you want to record ambient sounds like brushing or tapping. However, you should also keep in mind that this type of microphone can capture background noises which may impact the overall quality of the recording.</p>
<p>The binaural mics are composed of two microphones are used to record the left and right channel separately. You don’t necessarily have to get a binaural microphone in order to create a binaural audio recording since you can just use two different microphones to record the left and right channels individually.</p>
<h3 id="3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes"><a href="#3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes" class="headerlink" title="3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes"></a>3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes</h3><p>Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.</p>
<p>Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S&#x2F;N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.</p>

<p>A binaural mic will enable you to create a more immersive audio recording, but they are also more expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the world of video production, the quality of your equipment often determines how good the final product is going to be. That’s why a good microphone is one of the essential items for an ASMR artist.</p>
<p>Finding a good microphone you can use to record ASMR sounds shouldn’t be too difficult, because you can get a high-quality option in different price tiers. If you are on a budget, then a microphone like Blue Yeti may be a great choice, because it lets you choose between different polar patterns and it produces a great quality of sound.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 3Dio FS Pro II or Rode NT1-A Stereo microphones are worth investing in because they will enable you to record sound at a professional level.</p>

<p>ASMR can be triggered by visual, audio, and tactile stimuli, which is the reason why most YouTubers who produce this type of content dedicate a lot of attention to the image and sound quality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vast majority of ASMR videos you can find on YouTube utilizes audio triggers to spark the autonomous sensory meridian response in one form or the other. Consequently, the quality of the audio recording determines whether or not your videos will be able to trigger ASMR. That’s why we selected some of the ASMR microphones novice and seasoned YouTubers can use to record the audio for their ASMR YouTube videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have-3"><a href="#Part-1-Which-Features-Should-an-ASMR-Microphone-Have-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?"></a>Part 1: Which Features Should an ASMR Microphone Have?</h2><p>Thinking that you can use any microphone you can lay your hands on to record sound for you ASMR videos is a mistake, because the quality of the recording may not be at a satisfactory level if your microphone is producing a lot of self-noise or if it is not able to pick up soft noises.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the features and ASMR microphone should have.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-mic’s-source-of-power-3"><a href="#1-The-mic’s-source-of-power-3" class="headerlink" title="1. The mic’s source of power"></a>1. The mic’s source of power</h3><p>A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.</p>
<p>The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction-3"><a href="#2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The microphone’s recording direction"></a>2. The microphone’s recording direction</h3><p>Although there are a number of direction categories of microphones, ASMR content produces commonly use Omnidirectional and Binaural mics.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, an omnidirectional microphone can pick up sounds from all sides, which makes it a good option if you want to record ambient sounds like brushing or tapping. However, you should also keep in mind that this type of microphone can capture background noises which may impact the overall quality of the recording.</p>
<p>The binaural mics are composed of two microphones are used to record the left and right channel separately. You don’t necessarily have to get a binaural microphone in order to create a binaural audio recording since you can just use two different microphones to record the left and right channels individually.</p>
<h3 id="3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes-3"><a href="#3-The-level-of-self-noise-a-microphone-makes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes"></a>3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes</h3><p>Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.</p>
<p>Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S&#x2F;N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?"></a>Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?</h2><p>If you are thinking about starting an ASMR YouTube channel, you don’t have to get a professional microphone right away, because there lots of affordable mics that will enable you to create crystal-clear audio recordings.</p>
