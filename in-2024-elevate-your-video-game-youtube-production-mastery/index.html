Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-1"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-1"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-1"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-1"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-1"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-1"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-1"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-1"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-1"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-1"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-1" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-2"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-2"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-2"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-2"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-2"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-2"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-2"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-2"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-2"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-2"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-2" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Once you’ve completed the video editing process, you can click on the Export button and decide if you want to export a video directly to your YouTube channel or to a destination on your hard drive.</p>

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-3"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p>
<h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-3"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p>
<p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-3"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p>
<h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-3"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene-3"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-3"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-3"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-3"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p>
<p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p>
<h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-3"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded-3" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p>
<p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p>
<p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p>
<p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed. You can upload videos with 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios to your channel, and the platform support videos in resolutions up to 8K. The minimum length of a YouTube video is 33 seconds while a video’s maximum length cannot exceed the twelve-hour limit.

Optimize Your Content for YouTube Searches</h4><p>Every bit of information you add to the video increases its visibility on the platform. Even the name of the file you’re uploading to your channel should contain a keyword, and once the upload is completed you should add a title, description, and metadata if you would like to increase the video’s visibility on the platform. It is vital to select your YouTube SEO strategy before you actually start adding new videos to your strategy.

In addition, YouTube’s video editor enables you to <strong>add end screens</strong> that last anywhere between five and twenty seconds to your videos, but keep in mind that the video must be at least 25 seconds long to have an end screen. There are a number of fully customizable templates available that can be uses to promote your upcoming videos or to invite viewers to subscribe to your channel.</p>

Once you decide to make a video available to all YouTube users, you should share it on social media like Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr.

In case you don’t have your own audio and video footage you can download videos, music, visual and audio effects from a stock footage website like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmstock effects store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>The joy of creating on YouTube is often dampened by the disappointment of underperforming videos. You have published your content and it’s not getting the views you had hoped.</p>
<p>Well, let’s change that!</p>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through YouTube SEO from the very start to the very end.</p>
<p>Nothing complicated. No paid programs or expensive apps needed. We are going back to basics and get your videos discovered.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Let’s Go!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors"><a href="#Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors"></a>Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Come up with a video idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p>
<p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p>
<p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"
                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"
                ></p>
<p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p>
<p>Okay, don’t panic! There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"
                      alt="fantastic quote"
                ></p>
<p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p>
<p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p>
<p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p>
<p>- To be entertained</p>
<p>- To learn something new</p>
<p>- To be inspired</p>
<p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p>
<p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p>
<p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p>
<p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p>
<p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p>
<p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p>
<p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p>
<p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p>
<p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p>
<p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p>
<p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p>
<p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p>
<p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p>
<p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p>
<p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p>
<h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p>
<p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p>
<p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p>
<p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p>
<h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p>
<h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p>
<p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p>
<p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p>
<p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p>
<h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p>
<p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p>
<p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p>
<p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p>

                ></p>
<p>Who knows, who will respond.</p>
<h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p>
<p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"
                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p>
<p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p>
<p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p>

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p>
<p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p>
<p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p>
<p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p>
<p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p>
<p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p>
<p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p>

<p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p>
<p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords-1"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p>
<p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p>
<p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-1"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p>
<p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p>
<p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p>
<p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p>
<p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-1"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p>
<p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p>
<p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p>
<p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p>
<p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p>
<p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-1"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p>
<p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p>
<p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p>
<h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-1"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p>
<p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p>
<p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p>
<p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-1"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p>
<h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-1"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p>
<h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-1"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p>
<p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p>
<p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p>
<p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p>
<h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-1"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p>
<p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p>
<p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p>
<p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p>

<p>Who knows, who will respond.</p>
<h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-1"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p>
<p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"
                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p>
<p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p>
<p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p>

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts-1"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p>
<p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p>
<p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-1"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p>
<p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p>
<p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p>
<p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p>
<p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p>

<p>Well, let’s change that!</p>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through YouTube SEO from the very start to the very end.</p>
<p>Nothing complicated. No paid programs or expensive apps needed. We are going back to basics and get your videos discovered.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Let’s Go!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors-2"><a href="#Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors"></a>Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Come up with a video idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p>
<p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p>
<p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-2"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p>
<p>Okay, don’t panic! There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p>

                      alt="fantastic quote"
                ></p>
<p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p>
<p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p>
<p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p>
<p>- To be entertained</p>
<p>- To learn something new</p>
<p>- To be inspired</p>
<p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p>
<p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords-2"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p>
<p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p>
<p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-2"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p>
<p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p>
<p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p>
<p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p>
<p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-2"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p>
<p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p>
<p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p>
<p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p>
<p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p>
<p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-2"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p>
<p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p>
<p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p>
<h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-2"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p>
<p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p>
<p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p>
<p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p>
<p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-2"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p>
<h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-2"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p>
<h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-2"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p>
<p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p>
<p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p>
<p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p>
<h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-2"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p>
<p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p>
<p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p>
<p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p>

<p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p>
<p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p>
<p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p>

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p>

<h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts-2"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p>
<p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p>
<p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p>
<p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p>
<p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p>
<p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p>
<p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p>

<p>The joy of creating on YouTube is often dampened by the disappointment of underperforming videos. You have published your content and it’s not getting the views you had hoped.</p>
<p>Well, let’s change that!</p>
<p>In this guide, I’m going to walk you through YouTube SEO from the very start to the very end.</p>
<p>Nothing complicated. No paid programs or expensive apps needed. We are going back to basics and get your videos discovered.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Let’s Go!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors-3"><a href="#Part-1-Research-Your-Topic-and-Competitors-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors"></a>Part 1: Research Your Topic and Competitors</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Come up with a video idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p>
<p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p>
<p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-3"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"
                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"
                ></p>
<p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p>
<p>Okay, don’t panic! There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"
                      alt="fantastic quote"
                ></p>
<p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p>
<p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p>
<p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p>
<p>- To be entertained</p>
<p>- To learn something new</p>
<p>- To be inspired</p>
<p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p>
<p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords-3"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p>
<p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p>
<p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"
                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"
                ></p>
<h4 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-3"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p>
<p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p>
<p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p>
<p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p>
<p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-3"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p>
<p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p>
<p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p>
<p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p>
<p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p>
<p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p>
<p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p>
<p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-3"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p>
<p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p>
<p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p>
<h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-3"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p>
<p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p>

<p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p>
<h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-3"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p>
<p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p>
<p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p>
<p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p>
<h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-3"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p>
<p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p>
<p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p>
<p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p>

<p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"
                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"
                ></p>
<p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p>
<p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p>
<p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p>

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts-3"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p>
<p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p>
<p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-3"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p>
<p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p>
<p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p>
<p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p>
<p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p>
