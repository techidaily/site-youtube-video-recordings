<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. OBS Studio</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p>
<p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>

<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. OBS Studio</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>

<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>

This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

<p>There are no restrictions in terms of the duration of screen recordings you can make with Flashback Express and the software doesn’t watermark the video you create.</p>
<p>However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.</p>
<p>This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market. Having said that, it is still an excellent tool that will help you live stream gameplay easily. Although it doesn’t come with built-in video editing software, it is possible to download another program to do this for you (i.e. Filmora). Flashback Express has the ability to record through your headset or microphone as well.</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p>
<p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-3"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p>
<p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p>

This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p>
<p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p>

In order to save a video file you created, you just have to go to the File menu and pick the Save option.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Record-a-YouTube-Live-Stream-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Record-a-YouTube-Live-Stream-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Record a YouTube Live Stream with Filmora"></a>How to Record a YouTube Live Stream with Filmora</h2><p>Recording a YouTube Live stream with Filmora is easy even if you never went through this process before. You can set up a new screencasting session in just a few easy steps that won’t take more than a few moments to complete. Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Filmora and create a new project. Go to the Media tab once the video editor’s main window loads and click on the Record drop-down menu that is located next to the Import drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Choose the <strong>Record PC Screen</strong> option and then proceed to customize the settings for your screencasting session.</p>

                      alt="Record PC screen in Filmora9"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the Rectangular icon in the upper left corner of the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window and choose either Full Screen, Custom, or Target Window option, depending on how you want to record a YouTube Live stream to define the area of the screen that is going to be recorded.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-filmora-scrn-record-in-filmora9.jpg"
                      alt="Record PC screen in Filmora9"
                ></p>
<p>You can then proceed to insert the resolution your screen recording is going to have, and choose if you want to record system audio and sound from an external microphone.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Gear icon below the Record button to gain access to additional settings, and then proceed to set the frame rate, adjust the video’s quality or activate the <strong>Show Mouse Clicks</strong> in Recording option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Screen settings  in Filmora9"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that the checkbox next to the Record the Camera Stream is marked if you want to record webcam feed and computer desktop at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Press the red Record button in the upper right corner of the window and jump to the live stream. Once the broadcast is completed, you should click on the Stop button and use Filmora’s editing tools to remove all imperfections from the recording.</p>
<p>Filmora allows you to export all of your projects directly to your YouTube channel immediately after the rendering process is completed.</p>
