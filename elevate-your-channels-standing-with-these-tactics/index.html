<h2 id="1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently"><a href="#1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently" class="headerlink" title="1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p>
<h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p>
<p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p>

<h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p>
<p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p>
<h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p>
<p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p>
<h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p>
<h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p>
<p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p>
<p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p>
<h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p>

<h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p>
<p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p>
<p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p>
<h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p>
<h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p>
<p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p>
<h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p>
<p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p>

Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p>

<h2 id="18-Do-Collaboration-Videos"><a href="#18-Do-Collaboration-Videos" class="headerlink" title="18. Do Collaboration Videos"></a>18. Do Collaboration Videos</h2><p>When you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >collaborate with other YouTube creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p>
<p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p>
<h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p>
<h2 id="20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable"><a href="#20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable"></a>20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p>
<p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p>

Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.</p>
<h2 id="22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos"></a>22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p>
<h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p>
<h2 id="24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer"></a>24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.</p>
<p>You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.</p>

<h2 id="1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-1"><a href="#1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p>
<h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-1"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-1"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-1"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-1"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p>
<p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p>

<h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p>
<p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p>
<h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-1"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p>
<p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p>
<h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-1"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p>
<h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-1"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p>
<p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p>
<p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p>
<h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-1"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p>

<h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions-1"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p>
<p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p>
<p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p>
<h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p>
<h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-1"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-1" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p>
<p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p>
<h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-1"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p>
<p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-1"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p>

Do Collaboration Videos</h2><p>When you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >collaborate with other YouTube creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p>
<p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p>
<h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video-1"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p>
<h2 id="20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable-1"><a href="#20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable-1" class="headerlink" title="20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable"></a>20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p>
<p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p>

<h2 id="21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent-1"><a href="#21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent-1" class="headerlink" title="21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent"></a>21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.</p>
<h2 id="22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos"></a>22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p>
<h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views-1"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views-1" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p>
<h2 id="24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer-1"><a href="#24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer-1" class="headerlink" title="24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer"></a>24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.</p>
<p>You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.</p>

<h2 id="1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-2"><a href="#1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p>
<h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-2"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-2"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-2"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-2"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p>
<p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p>

<h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p>
<p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p>
<h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-2"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p>
<p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p>
<h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-2"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p>
<h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-2"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p>
<p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p>
<p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p>
<h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-2"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p>

<h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions-2"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p>
<p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p>
<p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p>
<h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-2"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-2" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p>
<h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-2"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-2" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p>
<p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p>
<h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-2"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-2" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p>
<p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-2"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-2" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p>

Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p>

Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p>
<p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p>

Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them.

Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p>
<h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views-2"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views-2" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p>

Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.</p>
<p>You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.</p>

<h2 id="1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-3"><a href="#1-Post-YouTube-Videos-Consistently-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p>
<h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-3"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-3"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-3"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-3"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p>
<p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p>

<h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p>
<p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p>
<h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-3"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p>
<p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p>
<h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-3"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p>
<h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-3"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p>
<p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p>
<p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p>
<h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-3"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p>

Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p>
<p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p>
<p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p>
<h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-3"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p>
<h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-3"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags-3" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p>
<p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p>
<h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-3"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p>
<p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-3"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p>

Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p>

<h2 id="18-Do-Collaboration-Videos-3"><a href="#18-Do-Collaboration-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="18. Do Collaboration Videos"></a>18.

You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p>
<p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p>
<h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video-3"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p>

Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p>
<p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p>

Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p>

Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p>

Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe.

There are plenty of simple and completely free ways that you can gain more YouTube views and consistently see more traffic on every video that you produce.</p>
<p>Here are the top 12 ways that you can increase YouTube views on your videos:</p>

<h2 id="1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists"><a href="#1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p>
<p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p>
<p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails"></a><strong>2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >High-quality video thumbnails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> play a major role in getting views for your YouTube videos. Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p>
<p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p>

Be a Part of the Community</strong></h2><p>Regularly viewing videos from other channels within your genre, especially channels about the same size as yours, and taking the time to leave thoughtful comments can help to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >build your presence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the online community. Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p>
<p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p>
<h2 id="4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends"><a href="#4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends"></a><strong>4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</strong></h2><p>New <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >trends are important to jump on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when other YouTube creators are having success with videos on a particular set of trends. If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p>
<p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords"><a href="#5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords"></a><strong>5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p>
<p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p>
<h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p>
<p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p>
<h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p>
<p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content"><a href="#9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p>
<p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p>
<h2 id="10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos"><a href="#10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos"></a><strong>10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Checking the analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your channel regularly is important for creators both big and small. The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p>
<p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p>
<p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p>
<h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p>
<h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12. Share your Videos on Social Media</strong></h2><p>The YouTube community is quite a large one on its own but it doesn’t hurt to extend your social reach by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >starting social media pages for your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p>
<p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p>
<p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p>
<p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p>
<p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p>
<p> These are all <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Seeing improvements with your YouTube channel isn’t necessarily something that happens overnight but with dedicated work and marketing, you can start to see your channel grow. Consider using some of these strategies to <strong>increase YouTube views.</strong></p>

<p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p>

Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p>
<p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p>
<h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names-1"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy-1"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p>
<p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p>
<h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags-1"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p>
<p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p>

Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p>
<p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p>

The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p>
<p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p>
<p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p>
<h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website-1"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website-1" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p>
<h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media-1"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12.

Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p>
<p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p>
<p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p>
<p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p>
<p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p>
<p> These are all <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Seeing improvements with your YouTube channel isn’t necessarily something that happens overnight but with dedicated work and marketing, you can start to see your channel grow.

There are plenty of simple and completely free ways that you can gain more YouTube views and consistently see more traffic on every video that you produce.</p>
<p>Here are the top 12 ways that you can increase YouTube views on your videos:</p>

<h2 id="1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists-2"><a href="#1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p>
<p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p>
<p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p>

Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p>
<p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p>

Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p>
<p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p>

If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p>
<p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on.

<h2 id="1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists-3"><a href="#1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p>
<p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p>
<p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails-3"><a href="#2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails"></a><strong>2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >High-quality video thumbnails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> play a major role in getting views for your YouTube videos. Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p>
<p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p>

<h2 id="3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community-3"><a href="#3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Be a Part of the Community"></a><strong>3. Be a Part of the Community</strong></h2><p>Regularly viewing videos from other channels within your genre, especially channels about the same size as yours, and taking the time to leave thoughtful comments can help to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >build your presence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the online community. Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p>
<p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p>
<h2 id="4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends-3"><a href="#4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends"></a><strong>4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</strong></h2><p>New <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >trends are important to jump on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when other YouTube creators are having success with videos on a particular set of trends. If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p>
<p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p>
<h2 id="5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords-3"><a href="#5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords"></a><strong>5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p>
<p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p>
<h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names-3"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy-3"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p>
<p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p>
<h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags-3"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p>
<p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content-3"><a href="#9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p>
<p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p>
<h2 id="10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos-3"><a href="#10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos"></a><strong>10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Checking the analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your channel regularly is important for creators both big and small. The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p>
<p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p>
<p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p>
<h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website-3"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website-3" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p>
<h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media-3"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12. Share your Videos on Social Media</strong></h2><p>The YouTube community is quite a large one on its own but it doesn’t hurt to extend your social reach by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >starting social media pages for your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p>
<p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p>
<p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p>
<p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p>
<p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p>
<p> These are all <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Seeing improvements with your YouTube channel isn’t necessarily something that happens overnight but with dedicated work and marketing, you can start to see your channel grow. Consider using some of these strategies to <strong>increase YouTube views.</strong></p>
