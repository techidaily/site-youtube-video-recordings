<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p>
<p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p>
<p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p>
<p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p>
<h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p>
<p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p>
<p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p>

It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p>
<p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p>
<p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p>
<p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>
<p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p>
<p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p>
<p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p>
<p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p>
<p>Simply choose a genre from the ‘Free Music’ drop-down menu to start browsing Free Stock Music’s collection. There are 10 genres including Pop, Hip Hop, and Corporate.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of ways to customize your search results on this site. You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p>

<p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p>
<p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p>
<p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p>
<p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p>
<p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p>

<p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p>
<p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p>
<p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p>
<p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p>
<p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p>
<p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p>
<p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p>

<p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p>
<p>In order to download songs, you will need to make an account, and it takes about 24 hours for your account to be approved.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p>
<p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p>
<p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p>

<p>All of the music on TeknoAXE is covered under a CC4.0 license, which means you can share and adapt the music for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.</p>
<p>TeknoAXE’s music is divided into four categories: electronic dance music, rock and metal music, orchestra and soundtrack, and miscellaneous. There are several sub-categories under every category.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p>
<p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>PacDV is primarily a sound effects site, but they have a music section as well (just click Music in the menu to the left under Sound Effects. ‘Free Music’ under resources is a completely different site). There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p>
<p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Credit them in your video description.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can’t buy a license for free songs to get around attribution, but they do offer paid music. At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p>
<p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p>
<p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you want to use the music for anything besides YouTube, or if you don’t want to give them credit, then you can buy a license for $5.</p>
<p>Purple Planet Music is a team of three people, two of whom compose, perform, record, and produce all of the music you’ll find on this site (the third is the studio manager).</p>
<p>From the home page of Purple Planet choose one of the categories listed under ‘Royalty Free Music’. The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p>
<p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p>

<p>You are only allowed 5 downloads per day while you’re using Sounds Crate for free. They also request a $10 annual donation from free users, but it’s optional.</p>

<p>Choosing great royalty-free music for your YouTube videos will help put your audience in the right frame of mind, cover up flaws in your background audio, and help viewers feel more engaged with your content.</p>
<p>YouTube provides a free audio library, but since a lot of creators use it everyone’s videos can start to sound the same. Here are 15 alternative places where you can get royalty-free music for free! It’ll say at the beginning of every section whether they require attribution or allow commercial use.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-1"><a href="#Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]"></a>Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]</h2><p>If you are using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will find there are some royalty-free music tracks and sound effects already pre-programmed in the Audio library. You will find different styles of music tacks, varying from Young &amp; Bright to Electronic. Download Filmora, and you will get the royalty-free audio library and powerful video editing tools.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p>
<p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p>
<p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p>
<p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p>
<h4 id="2-Bensound-1"><a href="#2-Bensound-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p>
<p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p>
<p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p>

It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p>
<p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p>
<p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p>
<p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>
<p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p>
<p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p>
<p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p>
<p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p>
<p>Simply choose a genre from the ‘Free Music’ drop-down menu to start browsing Free Stock Music’s collection. There are 10 genres including Pop, Hip Hop, and Corporate.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of ways to customize your search results on this site. You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p>
<p>You need to create a free account on Free Stock Music to access their songs.</p>

<p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p>
<p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p>
<p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p>
<p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p>
<p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p>

<p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p>
<p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p>
<p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p>
<p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p>
<p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p>
<p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p>
<p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p>

<p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p>

<p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p>
<p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p>
<p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p>

<p>All of the music on TeknoAXE is covered under a CC4.0 license, which means you can share and adapt the music for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.</p>
<p>TeknoAXE’s music is divided into four categories: electronic dance music, rock and metal music, orchestra and soundtrack, and miscellaneous. There are several sub-categories under every category.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p>
<p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>PacDV is primarily a sound effects site, but they have a music section as well (just click Music in the menu to the left under Sound Effects. ‘Free Music’ under resources is a completely different site). There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p>
<p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Credit them in your video description.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can’t buy a license for free songs to get around attribution, but they do offer paid music. At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p>
<p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p>
<p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you want to use the music for anything besides YouTube, or if you don’t want to give them credit, then you can buy a license for $5.</p>
<p>Purple Planet Music is a team of three people, two of whom compose, perform, record, and produce all of the music you’ll find on this site (the third is the studio manager).</p>
<p>From the home page of Purple Planet choose one of the categories listed under ‘Royalty Free Music’. The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p>
<p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p>

<p>You are only allowed 5 downloads per day while you’re using Sounds Crate for free. They also request a $10 annual donation from free users, but it’s optional.</p>

<p>Choosing great royalty-free music for your YouTube videos will help put your audience in the right frame of mind, cover up flaws in your background audio, and help viewers feel more engaged with your content.</p>
<p>YouTube provides a free audio library, but since a lot of creators use it everyone’s videos can start to sound the same. Here are 15 alternative places where you can get royalty-free music for free! It’ll say at the beginning of every section whether they require attribution or allow commercial use.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-2"><a href="#Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]"></a>Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]</h2><p>If you are using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will find there are some royalty-free music tracks and sound effects already pre-programmed in the Audio library. You will find different styles of music tacks, varying from Young &amp; Bright to Electronic. Download Filmora, and you will get the royalty-free audio library and powerful video editing tools.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p>
<p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p>
<p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p>
<p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p>
<h4 id="2-Bensound-2"><a href="#2-Bensound-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p>
<p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p>
<p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p>

It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p>
<p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p>
<p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p>
<p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>
<p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p>
<p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p>
<p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p>
<p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>

You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p>
<p>You need to create a free account on Free Stock Music to access their songs.</p>

<p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p>
<p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p>
<p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p>
<p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p>
<p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p>

<p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p>
<p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p>
<p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p>
<p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p>
<p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p>
<p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p>
<p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p>

<p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p>
<p>In order to download songs, you will need to make an account, and it takes about 24 hours for your account to be approved.</p>

<p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p>
<p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p>
<p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p>

<p>All of the music on TeknoAXE is covered under a CC4.0 license, which means you can share and adapt the music for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.</p>
<p>TeknoAXE’s music is divided into four categories: electronic dance music, rock and metal music, orchestra and soundtrack, and miscellaneous. There are several sub-categories under every category.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p>
<p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>PacDV is primarily a sound effects site, but they have a music section as well (just click Music in the menu to the left under Sound Effects. ‘Free Music’ under resources is a completely different site). There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p>
<p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Credit them in your video description.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can’t buy a license for free songs to get around attribution, but they do offer paid music. At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p>
<p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p>
<p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you want to use the music for anything besides YouTube, or if you don’t want to give them credit, then you can buy a license for $5.</p>
<p>Purple Planet Music is a team of three people, two of whom compose, perform, record, and produce all of the music you’ll find on this site (the third is the studio manager).</p>
<p>From the home page of Purple Planet choose one of the categories listed under ‘Royalty Free Music’. The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p>
<p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p>

<p>You are only allowed 5 downloads per day while you’re using Sounds Crate for free. They also request a $10 annual donation from free users, but it’s optional.</p>

<p>Choosing great royalty-free music for your YouTube videos will help put your audience in the right frame of mind, cover up flaws in your background audio, and help viewers feel more engaged with your content.</p>
<p>YouTube provides a free audio library, but since a lot of creators use it everyone’s videos can start to sound the same. Here are 15 alternative places where you can get royalty-free music for free! It’ll say at the beginning of every section whether they require attribution or allow commercial use.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-3"><a href="#Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]"></a>Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]</h2><p>If you are using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will find there are some royalty-free music tracks and sound effects already pre-programmed in the Audio library. You will find different styles of music tacks, varying from Young &amp; Bright to Electronic. Download Filmora, and you will get the royalty-free audio library and powerful video editing tools.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p>
<p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p>
<p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p>
<p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p>
<h4 id="2-Bensound-3"><a href="#2-Bensound-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p>
<p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p>
<p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p>

It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p>
<p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p>
<p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p>
<p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>
<p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p>
<p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p>
<p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p>
<p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p>
<p>Simply choose a genre from the ‘Free Music’ drop-down menu to start browsing Free Stock Music’s collection. There are 10 genres including Pop, Hip Hop, and Corporate.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of ways to customize your search results on this site. You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p>
<p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p>
<p>You need to create a free account on Free Stock Music to access their songs.</p>

<p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p>
<p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p>
<p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p>
<p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p>
<p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p>

<p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p>
<p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p>
<p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p>
<p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p>
<p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p>
<p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Unclear.</em> The site doesn’t address attribution so it may be up to whoever has uploaded the loop you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p>
<p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p>

<p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p>
<p>In order to download songs, you will need to make an account, and it takes about 24 hours for your account to be approved.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p>
<p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p>
<p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p>

<p>All of the music on TeknoAXE is covered under a CC4.0 license, which means you can share and adapt the music for any purpose so long as you provide attribution.</p>
<p>TeknoAXE’s music is divided into four categories: electronic dance music, rock and metal music, orchestra and soundtrack, and miscellaneous. There are several sub-categories under every category.</p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p>
<p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p>
<p>PacDV is primarily a sound effects site, but they have a music section as well (just click Music in the menu to the left under Sound Effects. ‘Free Music’ under resources is a completely different site). There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p>
<p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p>

<p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Credit them in your video description.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can’t buy a license for free songs to get around attribution, but they do offer paid music. At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p>
<p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p>
<p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you want to use the music for anything besides YouTube, or if you don’t want to give them credit, then you can buy a license for $5.</p>
<p>Purple Planet Music is a team of three people, two of whom compose, perform, record, and produce all of the music you’ll find on this site (the third is the studio manager).</p>
<p>From the home page of Purple Planet choose one of the categories listed under ‘Royalty Free Music’. The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p>
<p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p>

<p>You are only allowed 5 downloads per day while you’re using Sounds Crate for free. They also request a $10 annual donation from free users, but it’s optional.</p>

<p> If there exists searches, there exists SEO. YouTube now is the second largest search engine which processes more than 3 billion searches in a single month. Besides making sure that each video you upload to YouTube offers thought-provoking content, you can also optimize the video in accordance with the rules of SEO to stand out from the 500 hours of videos uploaded per minutes.</p>
<p> If you are trying to learn more about the SEO optimization of YouTube videos, you’ve landed on the right page, because in this guide we are going to take you through the process of improving the search rankings for each video you upload to YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="The-Basics-Five-Main-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#The-Basics-Five-Main-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="The Basics - Five Main Traffic Sources"></a>The Basics - Five Main Traffic Sources</h3><p> Producing a video and posting it on your YouTube channel is simply not enough to guarantee its success. You have to know where the video’s traffic will come from, because over 500 hours of video content are being uploaded each minute, and there are over 50 million content creators on the platform.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search"><a href="#YouTube-Search" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-search-traffic.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos"><a href="#Suggested-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>
<p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p>
<p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p>
<p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p>
<p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p>
<p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p>
<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>

<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value.

</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p>
<p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p>
<p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p>
<p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p>
<h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p>

<p> If there exists searches, there exists SEO. YouTube now is the second largest search engine which processes more than 3 billion searches in a single month. Besides making sure that each video you upload to YouTube offers thought-provoking content, you can also optimize the video in accordance with the rules of SEO to stand out from the 500 hours of videos uploaded per minutes.</p>
<p> If you are trying to learn more about the SEO optimization of YouTube videos, you’ve landed on the right page, because in this guide we are going to take you through the process of improving the search rankings for each video you upload to YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="YouTube-SEO-Guide-1"><a href="#YouTube-SEO-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube SEO Guide"></a>YouTube SEO Guide</h2><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu:</strong></p>

You have to know where the video’s traffic will come from, because over 500 hours of video content are being uploaded each minute, and there are over 50 million content creators on the platform.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search-1"><a href="#YouTube-Search-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-search-traffic.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos-1"><a href="#Suggested-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p> Suggested videos that appear next to the video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear after the video</p>

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising-1"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources-1"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources-1" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-1"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>

You have to know where the video’s traffic will come from, because over 500 hours of video content are being uploaded each minute, and there are over 50 million content creators on the platform.</p>

                ></p>
<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search-2"><a href="#YouTube-Search-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos-2"><a href="#Suggested-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising-2"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising-2" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-2"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-2" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources-2"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources-2" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>
<p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p>
<p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p>
<p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p>
<p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p>
<p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p>
<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>
<p> YouTube keyword tools:</p>
<p> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-2"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-2" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Video (Metadata)</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>User Action</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>
<p> YouTube tag generator:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube" >http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p>
<p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p>
<p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p>
<p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p>
<h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p>
<p> YouTube will do anything they can to keep viewer watch longer</p>
<p><strong>So what’s relevant to the content? YouTube</strong></p>
<p> Always suggest videos from the same creator (so you should use brand, channel name tags)</p>
<p> Evaluated what people watch next and which video they ignore.</p>
<p> Displays video with the similar titles and keywords&#x2F;tags</p>
<p><strong>So what’s relevant to the viewers? YouTube</strong></p>
<p> Learns your preferences, style, tasted</p>
<p> Considers what content might be interesting to an individual viewer: analyze viewing history, channel subscriptions, search history, viewing choices.</p>

<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>
<p> YouTube keyword tools:</p>
<p> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-3"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-3" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Video (Metadata)</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>User Action</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>
<p> YouTube tag generator:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube" >http://www.betterwaytoweb.com/tag-generator-for-youtube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-3"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p>
<p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p>
<p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p>
<p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p>
<h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts-3"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p>
<p> YouTube will do anything they can to keep viewer watch longer</p>
<p><strong>So what’s relevant to the content? YouTube</strong></p>
<p> Always suggest videos from the same creator (so you should use brand, channel name tags)</p>
<p> Evaluated what people watch next and which video they ignore.</p>
<p> Displays video with the similar titles and keywords&#x2F;tags</p>
<p><strong>So what’s relevant to the viewers? YouTube</strong></p>
<p> Learns your preferences, style, tasted</p>
<p> Considers what content might be interesting to an individual viewer: analyze viewing history, channel subscriptions, search history, viewing choices.</p>
